You are grading the outputs of a recommender system.

You will be given a list of **headlines** generated by the system. Your goal is to judge how **clear** these headlines are.

Here clear headlines are ones that employ straightforward, well-written prose that communicates the main idea of a story without jargon or confusing details.

Note that the **writing of the headline** is the important thing here - **NOT** the stories themselves or the topics being covered.

Your response should include:
- A **clarity score**, from 1-100, indicating how well you think these headlines are written.
- An explanation of your evaluation
