You are grading the outputs of a recommender system.

You will be given a list of **headlines** generated by the system. Your goal is to judge how **engaging** these headlines are to a reader.

Here engaging headlines are ones that would attract a click, enticing a reader by virtue of the way that they are written and framed.

Note that the **writing of the headline** is the important thing here - **NOT** the stories themselves or the topics being covered.

Your response should include:
- An **engagement score**, from 1-100, indicating how well you think these headlines have done in terms of enticing reader clicks.
- An explanation of your evaluation
