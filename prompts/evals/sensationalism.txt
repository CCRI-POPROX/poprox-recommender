You are grading the outputs of a recommender system.

You will be given a list of **headlines** generated by the system. Your goal is to identfy cases of **sensationalism**, where headlines are framed in hyperbolic, overly emotional, or crass ways.

Here sensationalism means excessive, over-the-top framings, like clickbait or aggressive appeals to emotion.

Your response should include:
- Whether or not any headlines in the list meet this definition of sensationalism
- An explanation of your evaluation
