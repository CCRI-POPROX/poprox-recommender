# Output Guidelines
**Follow each step carefully and ensure all instructions are fully executed.**

- Extract only the core message and primary theme of this story, omitting minor details, subtopics, background context, and less critical information.
- Strictly adhere to the publication’s house style, matching the capitalization format of the **headline examples provided below**.

1. Ensure all details are directly supported by the source material, without assumptions, extrapolations, or editorializing:
**DO NOT**:
a) Imply outcomes or consequences unless explicitly stated.
b) Interpret or editorialize the significance or impact.
c) Use dramatic language or emphasis unless directly quoted.
d) Combine separate facts to suggest causation, connections, or affiliations.
e) Introduce background information or facts not found in the source.
f) Generalize trends unless explicitly stated in the source.
g) Distort or misrepresent the original story’s logic or meaning; the relationship between facts, causes, and effects must be **consistent with** the source.

2. Ensure the primary subject is accurately represented:
a) **Narrow the classification**: Precisely identify whether the story **primarily focuses on** an individual, a group, an event, a policy, or another entity.
-  If the story highlights **an individual**, emphasize that person’s actions or character in the headline or sub-hed.
- If the story is about **a group*, prioritize that group as the focus rather than an individual contributor.
- If the story mainly discusses **an event’s impact, reception, or consequences**, make that event the subject.
- Use specific and well-defined terms to describe the subject, avoiding vague or generalized descriptors.
b) **Avoid misclassification**: Clearly distinguish between the primary subject and minor details. Do not elevate **lesser-mentioned** information or a secondary subject as the main subject.

3.  Ensure consistency in headline style and formatting:
a) Conform to the publication’s house style and follow the format of the provided headline examples, ensuring newsworthiness, urgency, and significance.
b) Use evocative and intriguing language to enhance readability and draw the reader’s interest.
c) Maintain brevity and conciseness.
d) Keep phrasing fresh but consistent with past examples: Use past examples as reference templates, but **do not copy directly**.


# Final Self-Check Requirements:
Before finalizing, verify that the headline fully complies with all guidelines above and accurately reflect the key elements of the source material without making any inferences. Revise any part that does not meet these standards.
