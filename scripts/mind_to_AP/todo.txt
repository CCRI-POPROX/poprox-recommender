##TODO::
1. save article_id, headline, topics(all of the mentions instead of 14) and the embeddings of AP article in a parquet file
       a. pass the headline of article through news encoder to get the embedings ✅
2. save article_id, headline and the embeddings of Mind article in a parquet file
       a. pass the headline of article through news encoder to get the embedings ✅
3. for each Mind article,
       a. calculate it's distance with all the AP articles
       b. determine neighbors
       c. assign topics
       d. store the augmented mind data (question where??)


how to assign topics???
    1. union (assign all the topics form all the articles)
    2. intersection
    3. union with support (if multiple articles (>K) have that topic)
    4. union with weighted support (how close the article to the topic or frequency)
    5. curate the corpass with numbers topics


Option #1: K= threshold or the cos_sim>=K
AP news topics intersection onboardings topics -> Mind category
AP news topics negation onboardings topics     -> Mind Subcategory


Option #2:
AP news topics intersection onboardings topics -> Mind category
AP news topics for the closest aricle (only 1) negation onboardings topics -> Mind Subcategory


Option #3:
AP news topics intersection onboardings topics -> Mind category
AP news topics negation onboardings topics. Map (HOW????) every subcatory to the article headline embeddings and pick the closest. -> Mind Subcategory
