      "subhead": "A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct",
      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct. \nAny movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows.\nThe 93-page report released Saturday by the Democratic majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee found additional travel taken in 2021 by Thomas but not reported on his annual financial disclosure form: a private jet flight to New York's Adirondacks in July and jet and yacht trip to New York City sponsored by billionaire Harlan Crow in October, one of more than two dozen times detailed in the report that Thomas took luxury travel and gifts from wealthy benefactors.\nThe court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, but it leaves compliance to each of the nine justices. \n“The highest court in the land can’t have the lowest ethical standards,” the committee chairman, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said in a statement. He has long called for an enforceable code of ethics. \nRepublicans protested the subpoenas authorized for Crow and others as part of the investigation. No Republicans signed on to the final report, and no formal report from them was expected. \nA spokesman for Crow said he voluntarily agreed to provide information for the investigation, which did not pinpoint any specific instances of undue influence. Crow said in a statement that Thomas and his wife Ginni had been unfairly maligned. “They are good and honorable people and no one should be treated this way,” he said. \nAttorney Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas who has been tapped for the incoming Trump administration, said the report was aimed at conservatives whose rulings Democrats disagreed with. \n“This entire investigation was never about ‘ethics’ but about trying to undermine the Supreme Court,\" Paoletta said in a statement posted on X. \nThe court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThomas has said he was not required to disclose the trips that he and his wife took with Crow because the big donor is a close friend of the family and disclosure of that type of travel was not previously required. The new ethics code does explicitly require it, and Thomas has since gone back and reported some travel. \nThe report traces back to Justice Antonin Scalia, saying he “established the practice” of accepting undisclosed gifts and hundreds of trips over his decades on the bench. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and retired Justice Stephen Breyer also took subsided trips but disclosed them on their annual forms, it said.\nThe investigation found that Thomas has accepted gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors worth more than $4.75 million by some estimates since his 1991 confirmation and failed to disclose much of it. “The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,” according to the report.\nIt also detailed a 2008 luxury trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito. He has said he was exempted from disclosing the trip under previous ethical rules. \nAlito also declined calls to withdraw from cases involving Donald Trump or the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after flags associated with the riot were seen flying at two of Alito's homes. Alito has said the flags were raised by this wife. \nThomas has ignored calls to step aside from cases involving Trump, too. Ginni Thomas supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden. \nThe report also pointed to scrutiny of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. Justices have also heard cases involving their book publishers, or involving companies in which justices owned stock. \nBiden has been the most prominent Democrat calling for a binding code of conduct. Justice Elena Kaganhas publicly backed adopting an enforcement mechanism, though some ethics experts have said it could be legally tricky. \nJustice Neil Gorsuch recently cited the code when he recused himself from an environmental case. He had been facing calls to step aside because the outcome could stand to benefit a Colorado billionaire whom Gorsuch represented before becoming a judge. \nThe report also calls for changes in the Judicial Conference, the federal courts’ oversight body led by Chief Justice John Roberts, and further investigation by Congress.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Blake Lively has accused her “It Ends With Us” director and co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the movie and a subsequent effort to “destroy” her reputation in a legal complaint",
      "body": "\n\nBlake Lively has accused her “It Ends With Us” director and co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the movie and a subsequent effort to “destroy” her reputation in a legal complaint.\nThe complaint obtained by The Associated Press, which The New York Times reported was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department, precedes a lawsuit. It names Baldoni, the studio behind the romantic drama “It Ends With Us” and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\nIn the complaint, Lively accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a “multi-tiered plan” to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed “repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior” by Baldoni and a producer on the movie. \nThe plan, the complaint said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively. \nBaldoni enlisted publicists and crisis managers in a “sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" meant to “bury” and “destroy” Lively if she went public with her on-set concerns, the complaint alleges. \n“To safeguard against the risk of Ms. Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr. Baldoni, the BaldoniWayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms. Lively’s credibility,” the complaint states. “They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr. Baldoni’s credibility and suppress any negative content about him.”\nThe complaint also says Baldoni “abruptly pivoted away from” the movie's marketing plan and “used domestic violence ‘survivor content’ to protect his public image.”\nBryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, called the claims “completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.”\nHe pushed back against Lively's allegations of a coordinated campaign, saying the studio “proactively” hired a crisis manager “due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production.\"\nFreedman also said Lively threatened to not appear on set and not promote the film “if her demands were not met.” \nThose demands were not specified in the statement, but Lively's complaint lists 30 demands that she said Baldoni and others agreed to after their tense sit-down over her hostile work environment concerns.\nAmong them: “no more showing of nude videos or images of women” to Lively and others on set and no more discussions about pornography, sexual experiences or genitalia.\nShe also said Baldoni should not ask her trainer about her weight without her consent, should not press her about her religious beliefs and should make “no further mention of her dead father.”\nAn intimacy coordinator was also required to be on set whenever Lively shared a scene with Baldoni and he was barred from entering her trailer or the make-up trailer while she was undressed.\nThe demands also stipulated that there would be “no more improvising of kissing” scenes or adding of sex scenes to the film outside of the ones in the script Lively approved when she signed on.\n“I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,” Lively said in a statement to the Times. A representative for Lively referred the AP to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.\n“It Ends With Us,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover's bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between the lead pair. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for “Deadpool & Wolverine” at the same time.\nBaldoni — who starred in the telenovela send-up “Jane the Virgin,” directed “Five Feet Apart” and wrote “Man Enough,” a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity — did respond to concerns that the film romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were “absolutely entitled to that opinion.”\n“If anybody has had that real-life experience, I can imagine how hard it would be to imagine their experience being in a romance novel,” he said. “To them, I would just offer that we were very intentional in the making of this movie.”\n___\nPhilip Marcelo in New York contributed to this report. \n\n",

      "subhead": "The top uniformed police officer in the New York Police Department has resigned amid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate",
      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The highest-ranking uniformed officer in the New York Police Department has resigned amid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate in exchange for opportunities to earn extra pay.\nPolice Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey ’s resignation Friday night, effective immediately, according to a department statement Saturday.\nChief of Patrol John Chell will take over as interim chief of department, and Philip Rivera will assume Chell’s duties as the head of the patrol division, the NYPD said.\nLate Saturday, Tisch replaced the head of the internal affairs bureau, which investigates alleged police misconduct, saying in a statement that the unit “must always be dedicated to preserving integrity and rooting out corruption in all its forms.” She appointed Edward Thompson as interim chief after Miguel Iglesias was relieved of his command.\nThe NYPD declined to comment on the allegations against Maddrey other than to say it “takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and will thoroughly investigate this matter.”\nA lawyer for his accuser, Lt. Quathisha Epps, said the move was overdue.\n“This should have been done a long time ago,” lawyer Eric Sanders said by phone Saturday. “This has been years in the making, this kind of behavior. This is not a shock for anyone who understands how things work in this department.”\nEpps filed a complaint Saturday against the city with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that Maddrey engaged in “quid pro quo sexual harassment” by coercing her to “perform unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities in the workplace.”\nEpps, who holds an administrative post in Maddrey’s office, said that when she finally pushed back at Maddrey's demands, he retaliated by claiming she was abusing overtime, prompting the department to launch a review.\nSanders said his client was then suspended without pay despite putting in her retirement notice earlier this week. \nEpps was the department’s top earner in fiscal year 2024, earning more than $400,000, according to local media reports — more than half of it in overtime pay. \n“Ms. Epps has endured profound harm at the hands of individuals who exploited their positions of power for personal gain,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"The retaliation she faced for standing up to this abuse underscores the need for immediate reforms to address systemic failures within the NYPD.” \nSpokespersons for the department declined to comment on the complaint, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said it is investigating. \n“These are extremely serious and disturbing claims that allegedly occurred at N.Y.P.D. headquarters in Manhattan,\" the office said in a statement. \nA spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams said Tisch, whom he tapped last month to steady a department roiled by investigations, is conducting her own departmentwide review “to ensure no high ranking officers are using their power inappropriately.\"\n“We are deeply disturbed by these allegations,\" Kayla Mamelak Altus said in a statement, while declining to comment further for now.\nMaddrey's attorney, Lambros Lambrou, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the various allegations. However, in a statement to the New York Post, he dismissed Epps' claims as “completely meritless.\" \n“What a convenient time to accuse somebody of misconduct after she’s caught stealing time,” Lambrou told the paper. “She’s obviously drowning and in the deep end of the pool without a lifesaver. She wants to take down as many people as she can.\"\nSanders responded that any overtime his client worked was at the request of Maddrey and approved by him and other department officials.\nMeanwhile, Maddrey has been the subject of other misconduct allegations, including one from a police captain who says she rebuffed his unwanted advances for years.\nJohn Scola, a lawyer for Gabrielle Walls, said in a statement that Maddrey’s departure “vindicates” the police captain, who this week amended her sexual harassment lawsuit against another top officer to include Maddrey. \nWalls said in the filing that she dreaded interacting with Maddrey because he frequently tried to kiss her, and at times took to hiding with the door locked and lights turned off.\n“We hope this high-profile resignation marks the beginning of a cultural shift to eliminate the pervasive environment of harassment and retaliation within the NYPD,” Scola said. \nA former officer has also claimed Maddrey coerced her into a yearslong affair while he was her supervisor, though that case was dismissed by a state judge last month, the New York Post and others reported.\nEarlier this year, an administrative trial judge in the department recommended dropping a disciplinary case against Maddrey regarding a November 2021 incident in which he ordered officers to void the arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him.\nMaddrey joined the police force in 1991 at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks to become chief of patrol in 2021, before being promoted to chief of department last December, according to his department biography.\nThe chief of department is charged with overseeing the department’s “crime-fighting strategies, quality of life initiatives, and operational plans,” according Tisch’s Saturday announcement. The chief of patrol manages the department’s largest bureau, which consists of 15,000 uniformed patrol officers and 3,000 civilians.\n“The NYPD works tirelessly to protect New Yorkers, and these roles are critical to keeping our communities safe,” Tisch said in her statement. “The interim Chiefs of Department and Patrol will continue to lead the efforts to reduce crime and disorder and build public trust.”\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Michael R.

      "headline": "After shooting, Wisconsin school and church lean into Christmas message for comfort",
      "subhead": "For Christians around the world, Christmas is the joyful celebration of the birth of Jesus",
      "body": "\n\nFor Christians around the world, Christmas is the joyful celebration of the birth of Jesus. To affirm their beliefs — that God is present and hasn’t abandoned them — the faith community at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is embracing its holiday traditions just days after a deadly shooting there.\n“When people say, ‘Where is your God?’ He is more evident now than he’s ever been to us,” the Rev. Sarah Karlen told The Associated Press. “I’m sure the phrase ‘Prince of Peace’ and ‘God with us’ is going to be leaned into a little more this year.”\nKarlen is a pastor at City Church, which in the late 1970s founded the school where she’s also the theater teacher. On Saturday, in the same space decorated with festive trees where students had performed their Christmas concert just the previous week, the church held the funeral of a 14-year-old student, Rubi Patricia Vergara. She was killed Monday when another student opened fire, also killing a teacher and wounding several others at the school on the same campus.\n“When we say that God is with us, especially here at Christmas time — when we say, you know, Emmanuel ‘God with us,’ that he came to Earth to be with us — I know beyond a shadow of a doubt each and every one of us here at City Church would say that in a very new way,” Karlen added.\nDecked in holiday light displays and a Nativity scene, the evangelical, nondenominational church with over 1,200 members also hosted a vigil service Tuesday.\nThen, drawing from Scripture and particularly the Book of Job, pastors addressed the challenge of reconciling faith in a loving God with his allowing great suffering to occur.\nKarlen also challenged some of the taunts on the school’s social media that questioned its religious beliefs. To the assembly’s applause, she repeatedly affirmed God’s presence in the midst of the grieving and the weariness.\n“None of us on our staff are saying that we understand why or how something happened. But we do understand that God sees us, sees things very differently than we do,” Karlen said later.\nPolice are continuing to investigate why Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow, 15, attacked the school before fatally shooting herself. While dozens of school shootings have happened across the U.S. in recent years, the vast majority are carried out by teenage boys and young men.\nBarbara Wiers said faith is helping teachers, students and families make peace with the possibility they will never have complete answers.\n“There may never be sense made out of this senseless tragedy. But. God, right? God understands, and God was there, and God is still here,” said Wiers, the school’s director for elementary education and communications. “Ultimately, it’s not about man’s judgment, although there’s going to be all of that — because of the legal system and how that plays out. But God’s just judgment will reign. And we trust him for that.”\nThe school remains closed as staff work to repair the physical damage so that it won’t retraumatize teachers and students immediately upon their return, Wiers said. Safety and wellness protocols are also being reviewed.\nBut on Christmas Eve, City Church plans to hold caroling and candlelight services, hoping that the community will draw comfort from the familiar traditions.\n“We know this is a long road for all of us, but the start is to be in the presence of God with one another, and to hug one another, and to sing together, to pray together,” Karlen said.\nOther churches affiliated with the school, as well as the broader community in Madison, quickly came together to help, from alumni starting food drives to evangelical ministries sending chaplains to pastors sitting up with those hospitalized.\n“Healing will come slowly, but they will not be left alone,” said the Rev. Kerri Parker, executive director of the Wisconsin Council of Churches, whose member organizations include about 2,000 churches and 1 million Christians.\nAt Saturday's funeral, Vergara's uncle, Andy Remus, said the family has “no bitterness or unforgiveness\" toward the Rupnows. He urged the school to continue its mission to teach Christian values and praised the community's response.\n“For every person that says, ‘Where is your God now?’ There are 10,000 good, caring people in Madison,” Remus said, his voice breaking. \nAbundant Life Christian School is part of Impact Christian Schools, a network of private educational institutions that welcome families regardless of their creed, said Impact’s executive director Chuck Moore. \nMoore said he hoped the shooting’s occurrence so close to the holidays wouldn’t forever tie Christmas with tragedy for the community.\n“Even in the midst of awful, it’s still a time we can rejoice,” Moore said. “We can focus our celebration on who Christ is.”\nAlready teachers at the school have talked about Jesus and faith in “every classroom, every subject, all day long, because God isn’t siloed to Sunday,” Wiers said. And that focus will continue when the school reopens sometime in January. \n“We’re changed. Our family is changed. But God hasn’t changed. He didn’t move. He hasn’t been altered at all,” Wiers said. “And the message hasn’t changed. God is good. God is good all the time. He is faithful and he is true. And while we are brokenhearted, he’s going to walk us through this.”\nIn the last prayer before leaving the church for the cemetery on Saturday, City Church's lead pastor also urged the community to let God's comfort and promise of eternal life break through the crushing pain.\n“There is a heaven, don’t let your heart be troubled,\" the Rev. Tom Flaherty said. \"This is not all there is, folks.” \n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "body": "\n\nMAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — One week after its worst cyclone in nearly a century, and a day after a testy presidential visit, France’s impoverished Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte is still grappling with counting the dead, restoring essential services and aiding a beleaguered population. \nCyclone Chido wreaked devastation across the archipelago. Already stretched thin, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients suffering not only from cyclone-related injuries but also from dehydration, malnutrition and disease.\nAt Mayotte’s main hospital in the capital, Mamoudzou, doctors faced a cascade of crises.\n“We lost 40% of patient rooms, about 50 to 60 beds,” said Dr. Roger Serhal, chief of the obstetrics and gynecology department. “There are so many patients coming to the hospital, and we don’t have space to admit them.”\nAs Chido battered the archipelago last weekend with 220 kph (136 mph) winds, Serhal and his team delivered three babies, including by cesarean section.\nThe hospital’s structural damage has forced staff to triage patients, prioritizing the most severe cases. Though the official death toll remains 35, according to the French Interior Ministry on Saturday, the number of seriously injured has risen to 78, with 2,432 others sustaining minor injuries. Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has warned that any estimates are likely major undercounts “compared to the scale of the disaster.”\nEmergency aid was being delivered by air and sea. Since the cyclone, 31 tons of food and 108 tons of water have arrived, with an additional 1.6 million liters of water expected Monday aboard a container ship, according to the Interior Ministry.\nThe hospital is operating at 50% capacity, while 109 patients have been evacuated to mainland France for urgent care. Three advanced medical posts have been established on Grande-Terre, Mayotte’s main island, to address the surge in need.\nThe storm has devastated entire neighborhoods. Many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. Even worse, many migrants avoided shelters out of fear of deportation, authorities said, adding there could be hundreds or possibly thousands of fatalities.\nDoctors fear that the lack of clean water and electricity — compounded by overcrowded living conditions — is setting the stage for a health crisis. “Patients are coming because their illnesses are untreated, there’s no water, and no electricity. We’re concerned about epidemics, like the cholera outbreak we stopped just months ago,” said Dr. Vincent Gilles, the hospital’s emergency medical director.\nThe hospital staff continues to work tirelessly, but resources are running dangerously low. “If we have rain it will be catastrophic,” Serhal said. \nAmong the patients struggling to recover is Saindou Mohamadi, 54, who fractured his arm and sprained his ankle during the storm that left his home completely destroyed. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mohamadi expressed despair for his family. “My mother is sick, I’m sick, and my child is sick,” he said. “They need to eat, but I’m the one who takes care of the food, and now we have nothing.” With six children to support, Mohamadi is among countless residents left homeless and destitute.\n“I’m not alone,” he said. “There are many of us who have lost everything — our houses, our food. I want the government to care about us, to give us food and a place to sleep.”\nMayotte, a densely populated archipelago of over 320,000 people, is also home to an estimated 100,000 migrants, many living in precarious conditions. \nThe poorest overseas region of France and, by extension, the European Union has long struggled with systemic neglect and underinvestment. Around 75% of its population lives in poverty, and the archipelago’s infrastructure was ill-equipped to withstand a disaster of this magnitude. Chido’s destruction has compounded these challenges, leaving many residents with little faith in the government’s ability to provide timely and adequate relief.\nEfforts to deliver emergency aid, including airlifts of water and food, are underway, but the scale of the need is staggering. Mayotte’s airport remains closed to civilian flights due to damage, further complicating logistics.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, during his visit on Friday, acknowledged the gravity of the situation and pledged to rebuild but faced criticism from residents frustrated by the slow pace of aid.\nCalling the archipelago “totally devastated,” Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau painted a bleak picture — with some 70% of the population gravely affected by the catastrophe, and many left homeless and vulnerable. For now, the island’s residents and its overstretched medical staff are left to confront the daunting aftermath of Chido, one day at a time.\n___\nAdamson reported from Paris. \n\n",

      "subhead": "After days of threats and demands, Donald Trump had little to show for it once lawmakers passed a budget deal",
      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — After days of threats and demands, Donald Trump had little to show for it once lawmakers passed a budget deal in the early hours of Saturday, narrowly averting a pre-Christmas government shutdown.\nThe president-elect successfully pushed House Republicans to jettison some spending, but he failed to achieve his central goal of raising the debt limit. It demonstrated that despite his decisive election victory and frequent promises of retribution, many members of his party are still willing to openly defy him.\nTrump’s decision to inject himself into the budget debate a month before his inauguration also showed that he remains more adept at blowing up deals than making them, and it foreshadowed that his second term will likely be marked by the same infighting, chaos and brinksmanship that characterized his first.\n“Stay tuned. Buckle up. Strap in,” said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., a senior appropriator.\nA glance at Trump’s agenda shows a cascade of opportunities for similar showdowns in the years to come. He wants to extend tax cuts that he signed into law seven years ago, slash the size of government, increase tariffs on imports and crack down on illegal immigrants. Many of those efforts will need congressional buy-in.\nFor many of Trump’s supporters, disruption could be its own goal. Thirty-seven percent of those who voted for him this year said they wanted “complete and total upheaval,” according to AP VoteCast, a broad survey of more than 120,000 voters. An additional 56% said they wanted “substantial change.”\nBut the past few days made clear the difficulty Trump could face in quickly fulfilling his goals, especially with Republicans holding only thin majorities in the House and the Senate. Some lawmakers already seem weary of the apparent lack of a unified strategy. \nSen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said the budget battle was “a valuable lesson in how to get our act together.”\n“There are no layups and it gets more complicated,\" he said. \nHow Trump's demands fell flat\nThe trouble started when top lawmakers released a copy of the bill, known as a continuing resolution, that was required to keep the federal government functioning until March. It wasn't the president-elect but Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a Trump confidant, who first began whipping up opposition to the legislation on social media by calling it excessive spending. \nTrump eventually waded into the fight. He ordered Republicans to cancel the bipartisan deal they had made with Democrats. And he demanded they increase the debt limit — the cap on how much the government can borrow — in hopes of preventing that thorny issue from coming up while he is in charge of the government.\nHe ratcheted up the pressure even as his demands shifted. First he wanted to eliminate the debt limit altogether. Then he wanted to suspend it until 2027. Then he floated an extension until 2029. \nIf there was a shutdown, Democratic President Joe Biden would take the blame, Trump insisted.\n“All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote “YES” for this Bill, TONIGHT!” Trump wrote Thursday, before a vote on a version of the bill that included a higher debt limit. \nInstead, 38 Republicans voted no. It was a stunning brush-off to Trump, whose power over his party has at times seemed near-absolute.\n\"Without this, we should never make a deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, his social media site. \nIf he didn’t get what he wanted, Trump said, there should be a government shutdown. He also said members of his own party would face primary challenges if they refused to go along, saying “Republican obstructionists have to be done away with.\" He singled out Rep. Chip Roy of Texas by name and with insults.\nBut in the end, lawmakers left out that debt ceiling increase, and a final deal passed early Saturday.\nMusk and other Trump allies tried to frame it as a win because the final legislation was significantly slimmed down and omitted unpopular items such as a pay raise for members of Congress. Charlie Kirk, the prominent conservative activist, wrote on X that Trump “is already running Congress before he takes office!”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he had been in “constant contact” with Trump, who, he added was \"certainly happy about this outcome.”\nIf Trump agreed, he didn’t say so himself.\nAfter days of frequent social media messages, Trump again went silent on Friday. He did not offer a reaction to the final vote or issue any statements. Instead, he went golfing at his Florida resort.\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, said the president-elect helped prevent an original deal “full of Democrat pork and pay raises for members of Congress.” \n“In January, President Trump and DOGE will continue this important mission to cut the waste out of Washington, one bill at a time,” she said. DOGE is a reference to the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory panel that will be led by Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. \nMore clashes to come \nThe circus-like atmosphere of the funding fight was reminiscent of Trump’s first term. Back then, one budget standoff led to a government shutdown when Trump demanded money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. After 35 days — the longest shutdown in history — he agreed to a deal without the money he wanted.\nIt was a political low point for Trump, and 60% of Americans blamed him for the shutdown, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll at the time.\nTrump didn't stop trying to bend Republicans to his will then. He's certainly not going to do so now. \nHe is cranking up the pressure on his own party over his Cabinet picks, pushing reluctant Republican senators to get on board with some of his most controversial choices, such as anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and then-Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. \nThe spending debates next year seem certain to further test Trump's influence in the House. Many conservatives view the rapid growth of the federal debt as an existential threat to the country that must be addressed. But some Republicans fear a voter backlash if steep cuts are made to federal programs upon which Americans rely.\nConcerns about deficit spending could intensify if Trump pushes expensive tax cuts that he promised during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security and overtime pay. \nHe also wants to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 that are set to expire next year. He has called for further lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the United States. \nTrump has said he will pay for the dips in revenue with aggressive new tariffs that economists warn will lead to higher prices for consumers.\nRep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said reducing spending would likely continue to be a gulf between Trump and House Republicans.\n“That’s never been really a campaign promise of Trump, but it’s a big priority for House Republicans,” he said.\nThere was no sense that the animosity was dying down on Saturday. Some Republicans faulted the House leadership for not securing Trump's “blessing\" on the original deal. Democrats cast Trump as second fiddle to Musk.\nWhile Trump stayed quiet, Biden announced that he signed the budget legislation. \n\"This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\" he said. “But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity.”\n___ Boak reported from West Palm Beach, Florida, and Colvin from New York.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day",
      "body": "\n\nHanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900.\nFor some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement.\n“This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness,” said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents.\n“The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other,” he said. “It’s others seeing you as you see yourself.”\nOne example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for a “cross cultural holiday celebration.\" The venue: Houston’s Holocaust museum.\nThe food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song “Hava Nagila.”\n“What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage,” said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston.\nRabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the party-goers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and “Anglo” Jews.\n“There’s too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos,” Tarlow said. “This is a way we can come together and show we support each other.”\nWhile Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism.\nRabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they’re visible through household windows and in public spaces.\n“The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it,” Hauer said.\n“It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world,” he added. “We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations.”\nHauer concurred with Stanton that this year’s overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is “an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith.”\nRabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time.\n\"Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it’s not taken for granted,” Seligson said. “One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly.”\nHe said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world.\n“There certainly is some apprehension,” Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. “Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past.”\n“What I’m hearing is there’s no way that we can’t,” he added. “The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever.”\nStanton concurred.\n“Through our history, we’ve been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard,” he said. “Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out.”\nWhy is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles, and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar.\nThe last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term “Chrismukkah” — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama “The O.C.” embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother.\nThis season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called “Leah’s Perfect Gift,” depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance, and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly.\nDespite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays.\n“The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah,” he said. “It’s a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish.” ___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "body": "\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday.\nThe two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa’s most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\nTen people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church.\nThere was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said, pointing out that some had been waiting since the previous night.\n“The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,” Loveth Inyang, a witness. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge.\nThree people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. \n“The event had not even started when the rush began,” police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said.\nViral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said.\nThe church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises.\nAs the church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures.\nNigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy with the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures.\nThe recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday this week when a local foundation organized a well-attended funfair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state.\nAfter the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that prior permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized.\nThe current economic hardship under Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who promised “renewed hope” when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation that is at a 28-year high and the government’s economic policies that have pushed the local currency to record low against the dollar.\nFrustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nTIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania's prime minister said Saturday the government will shut down the video service TikTok for one year, blaming it for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children.\nAlbanian authorities held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents following the stabbing death of a teenager in mid-November by another teen after a quarrel that started on TikTok.\nPrime Minister Edi Rama, speaking at a meeting with teachers and parents, said TikTok “would be fully closed for all. ... There will be no TikTok in the Republic of Albania.\" Rama said the shutdown would begin sometime next year.\nIt was not immediately clear if TikTok has a contact in Albania.\n TikTok in an email response Saturday to a request for comment asked for “urgent clarity from the Albanian government” on the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had \"found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.”\nAlbanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. \nThere has been increasing concern from Albanian parents after reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok.\nTikTok's operations in China, where its parent company is based, are different, “promoting how to better study, how to preserve nature ... and so on,” according to Rama.\nAlbania is too small a country to impose on TikTok a change of its algorithm so that it does not promote “the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on,\" Rama’s office wrote in an email response to The Associated Press' request for comment. Rama's office said that in China TikTok \"prevents children from being sucked into this abyss.” \nAuthorities have set up a series of protective measures at schools, starting with an increased police presence, training programs and closer cooperation with parents.\nRama said Albania would follow how the company and other countries react to the one-year shutdown before deciding whether to allow the company to resume operations in Albania.\nNot everyone agreed with Rama’s decision to close TikTok.\n“The dictatorial decision to close the social media platform TikTok ... is a grave act against freedom of speech and democracy,” said Ina Zhupa, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party. “It is a pure electoral act and abuse of power to suppress freedoms.”\nAlbania holds parliamentary elections next year.\n___\nFollow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini\n\n",

      "headline": "Bronny James discusses the challenge of dealing with his mental health following cardiac scare",
      "subhead": "The final buzzer sounded, the South Bay Lakers had won a game and Bronny James seemed completely at ease",
      "body": "\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The final buzzer sounded Saturday, the South Bay Lakers had won a game and Bronny James seemed completely at ease.\nBig smile. Handshakes with everyone. Even did a little dance step as he got to the bench.\nLeBron James' oldest son made his peace long ago with the realization that he's going to be judged differently because of who his father is. Bronny James insists that doesn't bother him, saying Saturday at the G League Winter Showcase that he looks at the game differently — and still with some challenges — after suffering cardiac arrest on July 24, 2023.\n“I’ve become resilient over these past couple of years fighting through injuries, mental illness, stuff like that,\" James said. \"Just, you know, coming in and working every day and staying the course.”\nThe mental challenge, he said, stems largely from the scare of that day 17 months ago.\n“Trying to get past that,” James said. “It's difficult, but I'm trying to work at it every day.”\nHe suffered cardiac arrest during a practice session at the University of Southern California and needed a procedure to fix what eventually was diagnosed as a congenital heart defect, then missed several months of basketball while recovering. The NBA cleared him to participate fully in the league back in May, and the Los Angeles Lakers — his father’s team — drafted him with the 55th overall pick in June, eventually signing him to a four-year, $7.9 million contract.\nBronny James has appeared in seven games with the NBA's Lakers, making history by being part of the first on-court father-son duo in league history, and has spent time in the G League as well to continue his development. The Lakers have made no secret that James is a work in progress, and the 20-year-old doesn't hide from that reality either.\n“He’s got a lot of attention on him,” South Bay teammate Devonte’ Graham — a veteran of more than 300 NBA games — told ESPN in a televised postgame interview. “He knows how to deal with it. I think he’s been playing good.”\nJames' final numbers Saturday: six points, seven assists, four rebounds and a steal on 3-for-7 shooting in 25 minutes in South Bay's 120-104 victory over the Osceola Magic. The athleticism was on full display at times — he twice went into traffic for rebounds, simply going over the maze of people to emerge with the ball.\n“I’m just showing up every day, trying to get better every day, trying to learn every day and playing my game every day,” James said. “And I feel like that’s what is getting me to have fun and enjoy this sport that I love every day.”\nHe wondered in the immediate aftermath of the heart episode if he would be able to play the game, and there were plenty of doubters — and naysayers — when he was drafted after averaging 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in his only college season.\nThe noise from the outside, he said, “flies in one ear and out the other.” He is just happy to be playing, whether it's on a makeshift court inside an Orlando convention center on a Saturday afternoon or on the bright lights of the NBA stage.\n“My family, my parents, they are extremely thankful that I'm not only able to play basketball but also just walk around and speak to other people,” James said. “It's a blessing to be able to play this sport that I love. There's a chance I wasn't going to be able to. So, I wake up and I'm thankful for that every day.”\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n\n",

      "subhead": "Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with “The Apprentice,” is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration",
      "body": "\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with “The Apprentice,” is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration.\n“With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,” Trump announced Saturday. \nBurnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like “Survivor” and “The Voice,” but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for “The Apprentice,” which first aired on NBC in 2004. \nTrump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name — though Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run. \nThe selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both — including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekend,” and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz. \nTrump’s first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on “The Apprentice” and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a “star.” \nAlmost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump’s television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building’s lobby. \n“Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,\" Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits before adding, “most notably, ‘The Apprentice’\" and noting that Burnett “has won 13 Emmy Awards!” \nLater Saturday, Trump announced in a separate statement that he was picking casino magnate Tilman Fertitta as his choice to be U.S. ambassador to Italy. \nBurnett, meanwhile, will be a special envoy, posts usually filled by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East — where Trump has already said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a “special relationship” with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts. \nBut Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.\nTrump previously announced on Dec. 2 that he was picking billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens for the more standard role of U.S. ambassador to Britain. That might raise questions about how a special U.K. envoy could overlap duties, but the president-elect said in his statement that Burnett “will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.”\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nAmazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract. \nThe strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip. \nBut workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers — many of whom have voted to unionize — even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them. Starbucks long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year. \nWhy are the strikes happening now?\nStrikes — particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity — can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers. \nBoth Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans. \nEmployees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe’s and the outdoor equipment company REI. \nBut turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.\nJohn Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are “desperate” to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration. \n“The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. “If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.”\nHowever, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer. \nTeamster-led strikes at Amazon\n\nThe Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters. \nThe prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking. \nThe union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries. \nThat type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry — transportation and trucking — that’s dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon’s ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees. \nMeanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a “false narrative” about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers. \nIn September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub. \nThe Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union. \nAmazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union. \nAmazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company. \nContract negotiations at Starbucks\nUnlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. \nBut Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, said the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. \nThe union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. \nIn launching the strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, Workers United said Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years. \nUnion leaders said the strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver, Pittsburgh and Columbus Ohio with plans for baristas to join the picket lines in New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis on Sunday.\nWithout providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike.\nStarbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.\nStarbucks workers walked off the job on two occasions last year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.\nPatricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office. \nTrump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his “commitments are to the working class,” Campos-Medina said. \n___\nDee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this story. \n\n",

      "subhead": "Lamar Jackson threw three touchdown passes and Marlon Humphrey scored on a fourth-quarter interception return to help the Baltimore Ravens pull even with Pittsburgh atop the AFC North with a 34-17 victory over the Steelers",
      "body": "\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — Lamar Jackson was solid in Baltimore's biggest game of the season so far.\nThen, after one of the star quarterback's rare slip-ups, one of his teammates delivered the play of the day.\nJackson threw three touchdown passes and Marlon Humphrey scored on a fourth-quarter interception return to help the Ravens pull even with Pittsburgh atop the AFC North with a 34-17 victory over the Steelers on Saturday.\nPittsburgh (10-5) would have clinched the division with a victory, but now the teams are deadlocked after the Ravens (10-5) won for just the second time in the last 10 games in this series. Baltimore clinched a playoff berth. The Steelers had already done so.\n“It was cool to get a pick-6, but clinching a spot in the playoffs, to beat the Steelers, I'm just happy that the guys came in, put in the work, and we just took care of business,” Humphrey said. “I felt that this team has had our number over the years. Just take care of business, man. I felt like the performance we put on wasn't perfect, but I felt like that's what we were supposed to do.”\nRussell Wilson threw two touchdown passes, the second of which tied the game at 17 with 5:14 left in the third quarter. Jackson answered with a 7-yard scoring strike to Mark Andrews, and after Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs, a 44-yard run by Derrick Henry put the Ravens in the red zone.\nThat drive came to nothing when Jackson was intercepted for just the fourth time this season, but then Humphrey — who was celebrating the recent birth of his son Duke — picked off Wilson and went 37 yards to the end zone to give Baltimore a cushion in a series that’s been razor-thin of late. The previous nine games between the Steelers and Ravens were decided by seven points or fewer.\n“My whole family's in town to help out with my wife and everything,” Humphrey said. “I was texting her before. I'm supposed to go pick her up from the hospital, discharge her with the baby. So there's a lot of just great things that happened this week.”\nJackson improved to 2-4 against Pittsburgh as a starter. This was his first time facing the Steelers at home since 2020.\n“I feel like we've been busting our behind all season long, had ups and downs throughout this whole season, but to clinch a playoff against a great team like that, that's great,” Jackson said. “That means we're moving in the right direction.”\nHenry rushed for 162 yards.\nPittsburgh entered the game with a plus-18 margin in turnovers, but the Ravens had the edge in that department Saturday. Baltimore recovered three of its own fumbles and had two big takeaways.\n“We didn’t control the run game. We never did. When you don’t, you’ve got to do some splash plays or win the turnover battle in a significant way, and we didn’t do that either,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “There were some balls on the ground that we didn’t get. Then obviously we turned the ball over going in -- it took seven points off the board -- and they had a pick-6. The rest is history, as they say.”\nJackson found Isaiah Likely for a 9-yard touchdown to open the scoring. Wilson answered with a 1-yard scoring pass to MyCole Pruitt, and the Steelers appeared poised to take the lead when the veteran quarterback broke loose for a 19-yard run in Baltimore territory. \nBut Ar'Darius Washington delivered a punishing hit on Wilson at the end of that play, jarring the ball loose. Kyle Van Noy recovered for the Ravens at the Baltimore 4.\nThe Ravens then drove 96 yards and took a 14-7 lead on Jackson's 14-yard touchdown toss to Rashod Bateman.\nWilson threw a 12-yard TD to Cordarrelle Patterson to tie it in the third.\nMilestones\nJackson set a team record with his 37th touchdown pass of the season, and he's now up to a career high of 3,787 yards.\nRavens receiver Zay Flowers had five catches for 100 yards, surpassing 1,000 on the season.\nHenry has exceeded 1,500 yards rushing for the fourth time. He's now up to 1,636, a mark he's only surpassed once — in his 2,027-yard campaign of 2020.\nInjuries\nSteelers CB Joey Porter Jr. injured his calf, and WR Ben Skowronek hurt his hip. ... Baltimore RB Justice Hill left the game because of a concussion.\nUp next\n\nBoth teams play on Christmas Day to wrap up stretches of three games in 11 days. Pittsburgh hosts Kansas City on Wednesday and Baltimore plays at Houston.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — First baseman Paul Goldschmidt and the New York Yankees agreed Saturday to a $12.5 million, one-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement was subject to a successful physical.\nGoldschmidt would become the Yankees' fourth significant addition since Juan Soto's departure for the New York Mets after left-hander Max Fried, closer Devin Williams and outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger. Goldschmidt's addition likely means Bellinger will be primarily an outfielder.\nThe Yankees still may be looking for a third baseman along with left-handed relievers: There are no lefty relievers on their 40-man roster.\nA seven-time All-Star, four-time Gold Glove winner and the 2022 NL MVP, the right-handed Goldschmidt joins fellow MVPs Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Bellinger on the Yankees. Goldschmidt became a free agent after completing a $130 million, five-year contract with St. Louis.\nHe spent his first eight seasons with Arizona and his last six with the Cardinals, slumping to a career-low .245 average last season with 22 homers and 65 RBIs. He revived his numbers late in the season, batting .283 with seven homers and 25 RBIs from July 28 on.\nGoldschmidt hit .295 with five homers, 16 RBIs and a .839 OPS in 167 plate appearances against left-handers this year and .230 with 17 homers, 49 RBIs and a .675 OPS in 487 plate appearances against righties.\nHe is a .289 career hitter with 362 homers and 1,187 RBIs for the Diamondbacks (2011-18) and Cardinals (2019-24). Goldschmidt batted .317 with 35 homers, 115 RBIs and a .981 OPS in 2022.\nNew York also finalized a one-year contract with right-hander Jonathan Loáisiga, a deal that includes a club option for 2026. Pitching coach Matt Blake said this week the 30-year-old right-hander could return in late April or May from Tommy John surgery last May 1.\n“I imagine him being one of the high-leverage guys,” Blake said. “Obviously, we got to take some time to get him right, make sure we don’t rush him into competition.”\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\n\n",

      "headline": "It's eggnog season. The boozy beverage dates back to medieval England but remains a holiday hit",
      "subhead": "It's eggnog season",
      "body": "\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — At Scoma’s Restaurant in San Francisco, this holiday season 's batch of eggnog began 11 months ago.\nThe process typically starts in late January, just after the previous year's celebrations are over. Nearly a thousand egg yolks, gallons upon gallons of heavy cream and roughly $1,000 worth of vanilla beans are mixed with sugar and a mega-cocktail of sherry, brandy and aged rum. The concoction is then stored at 34 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) and and gets stirred weekly for months.\nIs it worth the wait? Customer Phil Kenny seems to think so.\n“It’s a wonderful, specialty drink,\" Kenny said of Scoma's recipe, which has been honed in recent years to take advantage of the boozy beverage’ s aging process. \"This takes eggnog to a different level.”\nKenny and his wife, Laurie, aren't the only ones enjoying it this year.\n“A drink that you would sort of associate with grandma and grandpa on the holidays has become like a cult favorite here,\" Gordon Drysdale, Scoma’s culinary director, said earlier this month. \"We did not ever anticipate people actually being mad at us because we didn’t have it.”\nEggnog's roots date back to medieval England and a drink called “posset,” which included hot milk or cream, alcohol and spices. Recipes have evolved in the centuries since then, and non-dairy and alcohol-free options abound in recent years. But some — like the formula for the famous eggnog daiquiri at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop in New Orleans — stay the same, and remain secret.\n“I like to say it’s a little Christmas magic,\" said Jamie Gourges, marketing manager for the open-air bar in the city's iconic French Quarter. “We do not disclose any of our recipes at any point but it is delicious.”\nGourges will say, though, that theirs is made fresh each morning from right after Thanksgiving until Three Kings Day, also known as Epiphany, on Jan. 6. It's a tradition going back some 20 years at an establishment that was built in the early 1700s. Naturally, it's haunted by French pirate and privateer Jean Lafitte, who based his smuggling operations near New Orleans.\nTerry Wittmer, who lives in the Big Easy, is a regular customer and loves the holiday season at the bar.\n“It tastes like Christmas. It’s a little cinnamon-y. It’s smooth and if you drink it too fast you might get a brain freeze,” Wittmer said. “I live a block away so I’m here every day but I’m happier during Christmas.”\nEven for tourists who came for the bar's signature \"purple drank” daiquiri, the holiday beverage beckons.\n\"It’s not going to have a problem going down, let’s put it that way,” Cheryl Abrigo of Florida said as she sipped hers.\n___\nSmith reported from New Orleans, and Dazio reported from Los Angeles.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Jeremiyah Love spent two weeks off battling a knee injury and an illness",
      "body": "\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love wasted no time sending a message to his teammates Friday night.\nNothing was going to derail the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish in the College Football Playoff. Not chilly weather, not a motivated opponent ready to prove it belonged and certainly not an injury or even a lingering illness to the team's top runner.\nNow, with 12 more days for the second-year speedster to rest and recover before the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish face second-seeded Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, Love could be much closer to optimal speed when Notre Dame returns to action Jan. 1.\n“I probably sound pretty terrible, but I came off of a little injury. I’m sick,” he said before explaining why he slowed down at the end of the run that matched the longest in Irish history. “I was just out of breath. I was gassed.”\nAt 6 feet, 210 pounds, Love doesn't necessarily look like the model Missouri Class 5 100-meter champ. But looks are deceiving in this case, and Love has been showing the college football world all season just how dangerous he can be — even with a bad wheel.\nHe used most of the two weeks between Notre Dame's regular-season finale Nov. 30 and the playoff opener rehabbing the left knee he hurt against Southern California. Then, he was struck with an undisclosed illness.\nSo when Love ran through the Notre Dame Stadium tunnel for the first CFP game ever played on a college campus, he was nowhere near full strength against the nation's top run defense.\nIt didn't matter. \nAfter losing a yard on his first carry, Love took his second handoff, ran through a tackle at the line of scrimmage and sped past the other defenders for a 98-yard TD run — the longest in playoff history — as he watched the chase play out on the video board.\n“I’ve got the best view in the house. Every time I hand him the ball, I’m just watching, like what’s he going to do now?” Irish quarterback Riley Leonard said after the 27-17 victory over 10th-seeded Indiana. “It’s the little things. It’s that second or third down where he’s stiff-arming guys and getting first downs for us. He’s just a freak athlete.”\nLove finished the game with only seven more carries for 10 more yards, playing sparingly after he appeared to reinjure the left knee when he landed awkwardly after attempting to hurdle an Indiana defender later in the first half.\nBut the victory gives him more time to get healthier for Georgia's run defense, which allows nearly 130 yards rushing per game. Notre Dame (12-1) faces the Southeastern Conference champion Bulldogs (11-2) — just like they did in 1980 when Georgia's victory gave the program the second of its four national championships.\nThe Bulldogs have won all three games in the series against the storied Irish but might be without starting quarterback Carson Beck, who injured his throwing elbow in the SEC championship game.\nRegardless, Notre Dame thinks it's time for a change in this series as it attempts to produce the first 13-win season in school history. Notre Dame also is trying to end a 36-year drought without a national championship, the school's longest since winning its first title in 1924.\n“We wouldn’t be in this situation if we didn’t have 12 wins, so I’m grateful to be part of a program and a team that has been able to accomplish this,\" coach Marcus Freeman said. “But you know I’m greedy, and my focus is — although I don’t want their focus to be on it — my focus is going to be on find a way to get 13. That’s what matters.\"\nIt matters to Love, too, as he and the Irish prepare their encore performance.\n“Like I say, if we didn’t have a rushing quarterback, how many more touchdowns would this guy have?” Leonard said. “He'd be in (the Heisman Trophy) conversations nationwide. Obviously, I think people are starting to see how special he is.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "body": "\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, the brash speedster who shattered stolen base records and redefined baseball's leadoff position, has died. He was 65.\nHenderson died on Friday. The Athletics said Saturday they were “shocked and heartbroken by his passing,\" but did not specify a cause of death.\nKnown as baseball's “Man of Steal,” Henderson had a lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments over his nomadic 25-year career — an MVP, 10 All-Star selections, two World Series titles and a Gold Glove award.\n“Rickey was simply the best player I ever played with. He could change the outcome of a game in so many ways,\" said Don Mattingly, Henderson's teammate with the New York Yankees from 1985-89. \"It puts a smile on my face just thinking about him. I will miss my friend.”\nIt was stealing bases where Henderson made his name and dominated the sport like no other.\nHe broke through with 100 steals in his first full season in the majors in 1980, topping Ty Cobb's AL single-season record with Billy Martin's “Billy Ball” Oakland Athletics. He barely slowed playing for nine franchises over the next two decades. He broke Lou Brock's single-season record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982 and led the league in steals for seven straight seasons and 12 overall.\nHenderson surpassed Brock's career record when he stole his 939th base on May 1, 1991, for Oakland, and famously pulled third base out of the ground and showed it off to the adoring crowd before giving a speech that he capped by saying: “Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but today I am the greatest of all time.”\nHenderson finished his career with 1,406 steals. His 468-steal edge over Brock matches the margin between Brock and Jimmy Rollins, who is in 46th place with 470.\n“He’s the greatest leadoff hitter of all time, and I’m not sure there’s a close second,” former A's executive Billy Beane said of Henderson.\nIn September, Henderson insisted he would have had many more steals in his career and in the record-breaking 1982 season if rules introduced in 2023 to limit pickoff throws and increase the size of bases had overlapped with his career.\n“If I was playing today, I would get 162, right now, without a doubt,\" he said. \"Because if they had had that rule, you can only throw over there twice, you know how many times they would be throwing over there twice and they’d be going, ‘Ah, (shoot), can y’all send him to third? Give him two bases and send him to third.’ That would be me.”\nHe even predicted how he could still be stealing more bases than the current major leaguers even 20-plus years post-retirement: \"If they’re stealing 40-50 bases right now I’d lead the league.”\nHenderson’s accomplishment that record-breaking day in 1991 was slightly overshadowed that night when Nolan Ryan threw his record seventh career no-hitter. Henderson already had been Ryan’s 5,000th career strikeout victim, which led him to say, “If you haven’t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you’re nobody.”\nThat was clearly not the case for Henderson. He is also the career leader in runs scored with 2,295 and in leadoff home runs with 81, ranks second to Barry Bonds with 2,190 walks and is fourth in games played (3,081) and plate appearances (13,346). He finished his career with 3,055 hits over 25 seasons spent with Oakland, the Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim, the New York Mets, Seattle, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nHe fittingly finished his career with the Dodgers at age 44 in 2003 by scoring a run in his final play on a major league field.\nHenderson is the third prominent baseball Hall of Famer with ties to the Bay Area who died this year, following the deaths in June of former Giants stars Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda.\nHenderson was the rare position player who hit from the right side and threw with his left arm — but then again, everything about Henderson was unique.\nHe batted out of an extreme crouch, making for a tighter strike zone that contributed to his high walk total. He struck fear in opponents with his aggressive leads off first, his fingers twitching between his legs inside his batting gloves as he eyed the pitcher and the next base.\nBorn on Christmas Day in 1958 in Chicago in the back of his parents' Chevy, Henderson grew up in Oakland and developed into a star athlete. He played baseball, basketball and football at Oakland Tech High School and was a highly sought-after football recruit who could have played tailback at Southern California — where he likely would have eventually had the chance to run alongside football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen.\nBut Henderson said his mother loved baseball and thought it would be the safer career in a decision that proved to be prescient.\n“She didn’t want her baby to get hurt,” Henderson told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019. “I was mad, but she was smart. Overall, with the career longevity and the success I had, she made the right decision. Some of the players in football now have short careers and they can barely move around when they’re done.”\nHenderson was selected in the fourth round of the 1976 amateur draft by the hometown A's and made his big league debut in 1979 with two hits — and, of course, one stolen base.\nHe became a star for the A's the following season and remained in Oakland through 1984 before being traded to the Yankees. Henderson was part of some talented teams in New York that never made the postseason. In 1985, he scored 146 runs in 143 games to go along with a league-leading 80 steals and 24 homers, helping start the \"80-20 club\" that season with Cincinnati's Eric Davis.\nHenderson was traded back to Oakland in June 1989, leading to his greatest successes. He topped the AL that season with 113 runs, 126 walks and 77 steals, was named the ALCS MVP and helped lead the A's to the World Series title in the earthquake-interrupted Bay Bridge series by sweeping the Giants.\nHenderson then won the AL MVP the following season for Oakland before the A's lost the World Series to Cincinnati.\n“I traded Rickey Henderson twice and brought him back more times than that,” former A's general manager Sandy Alderson said. \"He was the best player I ever saw play. He did it all — hit, hit for power, stole bases, and defended — and he did it with a flair that enthused his fans and infuriated his opponents. But everyone was amused by his personality, style, and third-person references to himself. He was unique in many ways.\n“Rickey stories are legion, legendary, and mostly true. But behind his reputation as self-absorbed was a wonderful, kind human being who loved kids. His true character became more evident over time. Nine different teams, one unforgettable player.”\nHenderson set the career steals record in 1991 and then was traded two years later to Toronto, where he won his second World Series. He spent the final decade of his career bouncing around the majors and still led the AL with 66 steals and 118 walks at age 39 with Oakland in 1998. \nIn 2017, the A's named their playing surface “Rickey Henderson Field” at the Oakland Coliseum in his honor.\n“When you’re old and grey, sitting around with your buds talking about your career in baseball, you are going to talk about Rickey,\" said Ron Guidry, another of Henderson's former Yankees teammates. \"He was just amazing to watch. There were great outfielders. There were great base stealers. There were great home run hitters. Rickey was a combination of all of those players. He did things out there on the field that the rest of us dreamed of.”\n___\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley contributed to this report.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\n",

      "subhead": "Jaydon Blue ran for 146 yards and two touchdowns, the last a 77-yard burst in the fourth quarter, and Texas beat Clemson 38-24 on Saturday in the first round of the expanded College Football Playoff",
      "body": "\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Jaydon Blue had the biggest run in the biggest game of the season so far for Texas. He had to fight through a nagging ankle injury and fumble problems to do it.\nBlue ran for 146 yards, dashing 77 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to help the Longhorns beat Clemson 38-24 on Saturday in the first round of the expanded College Football Playoff.\nBlue was first thrust into the starting role when training camp injuries knocked out C.J. Baxter and Christian Clark for the season. Blue missed a game with the ankle injury, then saw his carries reduced over several games because of fumble problems. \nTexas (12-2), the No. 5 seed, advanced to the Jan. 1 Peach bowl to play Big 12 champion and No. 4 seed Arizona State.\n“You can’t win (the championship) if you don’t win the first one,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We did that.”\nBlue already had a 38-yard touchdown earlier in the game. The second one came after Clemson had rallied from down 31-10 to within 31-24 on Cade Klubnik's third touchdown pass.\nBlue scored on 38-yard cut-and-dash burst in the second quarter. On the second touchdown, he dove into the line, shook a tackler, and then outraced three more to the end zone with just 11 minutes left.\nHe clutched the ball tightly to his chest when a defender tried to rip it away.\n“It was a sigh of relief after everything I’ve been going through,” Blue said. “I stayed patient, I saw a crease and it was everything (open) from there.”\nSarkisian said Blue never lost the trust of the team.\n“Our staff, his teammates, believed in him,\" Sarkisian said. “I just gave him a big hug and told him how proud I was.”\nQuintrevion Wisner added 110 yards rushing and two first-half touchdowns for Texas. Quinn Ewers passed for 202 yards and a touchdown.\nKlubnik, who grew up in Austin, passed for 336 yards and rallied the Tigers (10-4) in the second half against a Texas defense that had given up just four passing touchdowns all season. \n“We just got ourselves in too big a hole in the first half. Everything was uphill.” Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. “We just put it in Cade’s hands and let it rip.\"\nThe runner-up in the Southeastern Conference, Texas is the only one of last season’s four playoff teams to make the new 12-team field. Clemson won the ACC championship to make the playoff. The Tigers were the No. 12 seed in their first appearance since 2020 and seventh overall.\n\"It's not easy to get on this stage (again), and they earned it,\" Sarkisian said. “It think college football got this one right. This idea of a home playoff game with a 12-team format was pretty special.” \nTakeaways\nClemson: The Tigers had three big fourth-down chances in the fourth quarter. They turned the first one into a touchdown when Klubnik threw to T.J. Moore. But they came up short on the next two. Keith Adams Jr. was stuffed at the Texas 1 and Klubnik pass at the Texas 26 was incomplete with just over a minute left.\n“We've got big people,” Sarkisian said. “And they know how to play a physical brand of football.”\nTexas: The Longhorns had some injury scares that could be worrisome with more games ahead. Wisner, starting offensive tackle Cam Williams and center Jake Majors all left the field in two plays in the second quarter. Sarkisian said the coaching staff opted to keep Wisner and Majors out in the second half. Williams needed help to get off the field and will have tests on his knee overnight.\nReceiving record\nTexas tight end Gunnar Helm caught six passes for 77 yards, including a 19-yard touchdown that saw him reach high and still get his feet down in the end zone. He has 55 catches on the season, breaking the previous school record for tight ends. The record was 54, set last season by J.T. Sanders.\nUp next\nClemson will try to defend its ACC title next season and earn its eighth playoff berth.\nTexas moves on to face Arizona State in the next round. The Longhorns left the Big 12 before Arizona State joined that league this season.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "subhead": "Tiger Woods and his 15-year-old son Charlie are tied for the lead in the PNC Championship",
      "body": "\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tiger Woods and 15-year-old son Charlie ran off five straight birdies on the back nine Saturday for a 13-under 59 in the scramble format, giving them a share of the lead in the PNC Championship in Woods' first competition since back surgery in September.\nWoods said he scheduled that surgery — the sixth on his lower back in the last 10 years — to be sure he recovered in time to play with his son for the fifth straight year.\nThis is the first time they have shared the lead after the opening round, joined by the last two champions — Bernhard Langer and son Jason, and Vijay Singh and son Qass.\nWoods hit an array of good shots, including a wedge to inches on the short par-4 seventh, but otherwise downplayed his game by suggesting he still had a lot of rust. This was more about spending 36 holes on a brisk day at the Ritz-Carlton Club Orlando with his son, a sophomore at Benjamin School in North Palm Beach.\nHis daughter, Sam, caddied for her father for the second straight year. Their mother, Elin, was among those in the gallery in a tournament that is all about family.\n“We're trying to pull off each and every shot for each other, and to ham-and-egg,” Woods said. “And I think we did that great pretty much the entire day. We picked each other up, which was great. And Charlie made pretty much most of the putts today.”\nIt helped playing in the same group with former British Open champion Justin Leonard and his son, Luke, a senior and teammate with Charlie at Benjamin School.\nLanger extended his astonishing record on the PGA Tour Champions this year by winning for an 18th consecutive season. He and his son made eight birdies in a nine-hole stretch in the middle of the round, and they had an eagle on the 14th hole.\nSingh and his son, who won this event in 2022, shot 28 on the back nine.\n“There's so many teams in the hunt,” Langer said. “It's anybody's game that is within three or four shots of the leaders, which is most of the field.”\nPadraig Harrington and son Paddy, and Tom Lehman and son Sean, were at 12-under 60. The Lehmans looked to be leading when they were around the green on the par-5 18th, but then it took them four shots to get down in the scramble format, taking bogey.\nHaving Team Woods in the mix is enough to get attention.\n“It's great for the tournament and happy for them,” Langer said. “Should be fun for the crowd tomorrow to come out and watch everybody play.”\nWoods hasn't competed since the British Open in July.\nFor Team Woods, it's a matter of not looking too far ahead. The father knows that all too well with his record-tying 82 titles on the PGA Tour. The son got a lesson in that this summer.\nCharlie Woods qualified for his first U.S. Junior Amateur, making it to Oakland Hills but not staying very long. He shot rounds of 82-80 and didn't make it to match play. He also fell short in Monday qualifying for the Cognizant Classic on the PGA Tour and U.S. Open qualifying.\nBut he said the U.S. Junior was his biggest learning moment.\n“It's about focusing on my playing,” Charlie said. “I was so focused on winning and how I played that it kind of crept into how am I going to win instead of how I’m going to play the shot. And it kind of built up and that caused two very, very bad rounds of golf. But live and learn.”\nHis father listened to the answer and nodded.\n“Learn,” Woods said.\nThe PNC Championship is for players who won a major or The Players Championship and a family member. Annika Sorenstam is playing with her son, while Nelly Korda is playing with her father. Steve Stricker — winner of seven senior majors — is playing with daughter Izzy, a freshman at Wisconsin.\nKorda dazzled with a fairway metal out of the sand on the par-5 14th to set up eagle. Team Korda was four shots behind.\n___\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\n",

      "headline": "Isolated Chicago communities secure money for a coveted transit project before Trump takes office",
      "subhead": "Decades after a former Chicago mayor pledged to extend transit to the city’s far South Side, the federal government is committing to the massive project just before President Joe Biden leaves office",
      "body": "\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — Adella Bass dropped her in-person college classes because it was just too hard to get there from the far South Side of Chicago, where the city's famous elevated train doesn't run. And it can take her nearly two hours to get to the hospital where she is treated for a heart condition.\nBut things are looking up, with bright red signs across the area boldly proclaiming, \"Ready, Set, Soon!” Next year, the city is poised to start making good on a decades-old promise to connect some of its most isolated, poor and polluted neighborhoods to the rest of the city through mass transit.\nThe Biden administration notified Congress last week that it would commit $1.9 billion toward a nearly $5.7 billion project to add four new L stations on the South Side, the Chicago system’s largest expansion project in history. The pledge, which the Federal Transit Administration is expected to formally sign before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, essentially locks in current and future funding.\nStill, Bass fears President-elect Donald Trump's administration might try to scuttle it.\nSignals abound to assure residents that the project is “a go,” said Bass, who is raising three young children and works on health equity issues that affect residents of a massive public housing development near her South Side home. \"But you just never know with Trump.”\nCould Trump slash transit funding?\nThe $1 trillion infrastructure plan Biden signed into law in 2021 focused far more heavily on transit than anything his predecessor advocated. That is why there has been a scramble to finalize some transit grants before Biden's term ends, including commitments last week for rapid transit upgrades in San Antonio and Salt Lake City.\nYonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, said Trump unsuccessfully encouraged Congress in his first term to pass budgets eliminating funding for some new transit projects that hadn't secured their grant agreements. But it has been practically unheard of for administrations to claw back projects after they won final approval.\nSteve Davis, who handles transportation strategy for Smart Growth America, said Trump could try to redirect future competitive grants to prioritize highway construction over alternative transportation methods such as transit. He said Trump's Transportation Department could potentially slow down some allocations from already approved infrastructure projects but would have trouble halting them entirely.\n“If you're building an enormous $2 billion road widening, you need to know you're going to have money in year four or five and there's nothing a hostile administration could do to stop it,” Davis said.\nBringing back jobs through access\nOne of the communities that would be served by a new Chicago L station is Roseland, a once-thriving, predominantly Black business district that has fallen victim to the loss of manufacturing and a spike in crime. \nJervon Hicks, who spent many years in and out of jail on gun charges, turned his life around and ended up becoming a mentor for at-risk youth. The new station could help quicken the same transition for others, he said.\n“Roseland needs a makeover,” Hicks said. “We lack a pet store. We used to have a theater. Take some of these abandoned buildings and turn them into job opportunities.”\nUnlike the busy “Magnificent Mile” shopping district on Michigan Avenue in the downtown Chicago Loop, the business district on South Michigan Avenue in Roseland has fallen from more than 90% occupancy decades ago to around 10% now.\nAmong the surviving businesses is Edwards Fashions. Owner Ledall Edwards hopes transportation will spur more to return.\n“I don’t think it’ll get to the level it was back in the 1970s, but I think the environment is going to improve because of the accessibility,\" he said. “You’re going to be able to get people here in this area much faster.”\nRogers Jones, who for 30 years has run the Youth Peace Center next to the future train station, said he can't wait for the transformation.\n“The community is going to change,” Jones said. “It’s going to be a vibrant community, and people are excited. I know I’m excited.”\nA 55-year-old promise\nFormer Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley told residents of Roseland and surrounding areas in 1969 that the L would eventually expand there. \nTammy Chase, a spokesperson for the Chicago Transit Authority, said the cost then would have been $114 million compared to around $5.7 billion now, a figure that would keep rising the longer construction is delayed.\nThe agency has hired a construction firm, opened a Roseland office in a former paint store and begun boarding up homes that will be demolished for the tracks to run through. Ground is expected to be broken in late 2025, Chase said.\nU.S. Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees transportation spending, points out Chicago's transit system survived wars and depression. It surely also can withstand a pandemic and a presidential administration with different priorities, he said.\n“The big infrastructure projects stand the test of time,” Quigley said. \"These ups and downs, you have to adjust to them, but you recognize transit always comes back. If transit doesn’t come back, it stymies opportunities going forward.”\n\n",

      "subhead": "The U.S. military says two U.S. Navy pilots have been shot down over the Red Sea in an apparent “friendly fire” incident",
      "body": "\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent “friendly fire” incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels.\nBoth pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become, with ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area.\nThe U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time of the friendly fire incident, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what the pilots' mission was and did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.\nThe F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea.\n“The guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,” Central Command said in a statement.\nFrom the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the “Red Rippers” of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. \nHowever, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past.\nSince the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. \nOn Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen which the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a “missile storage facility” and a “command-and-control facility,” without elaborating.\nHouthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. However, there were no images or information released regarding the strikes — which has happened previously when airstrikes hit vital facilities for the rebels. \nBrig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, released a prerecorded statement hours later in which he claimed the rebels launched eight drones and 17 cruise missiles in their attack. He also claimed without offering any evidence that the Houthis shot down the F/A-18, likely following a pattern of him making exaggerated claims. During the Eisenhower's deployment, he repeatedly falsely claimed the carrier had been struck by Houthi fire. \nThe Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.\nIsrael’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians.\nThe Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.\nThe rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.\nThe Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.\nOn Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would act “forcefully” against the Houthis, as it has against other allies of Iran, “only in this case, we are not acting alone.”\n\n",

      "headline": "Caitlin Clark effect hasn't reversed the decades-long decline in girls basketball participation",
      "subhead": "Nebraska's third-largest high school decided not to play varsity girls basketball this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport",
      "body": "\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Plunging participation in girls basketball led one of Nebraska's largest high schools to cancel its varsity team for the year. \nThe decision by Grand Island Senior High School — the state's third-largest with more than 2,600 students — reflects a national decline in participation in the girls sport, even as the popularity of women's basketball behind the likes of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese has sent record numbers of fans flocking to arenas or tuning in on TV. \nSchools across the country have made similar choices, but that hasn’t made the move any easier for those passionate about Grand Island basketball.\n“We’ve seen the train coming. I mean we’ve been sitting on the tracks forever. But frankly, people just didn’t want to do the heavy lifting that was required,” said Jeremy Jensen, a former Grand Island mayor and high school soccer coach who wishes more had been done to build a sustainable girls basketball program.\nWhat happened in Grand Island?\nThe high school in the largely blue-collar city of 52,000 about 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Omaha decided to cancel its varsity and junior varsity teams this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport.\nThe team suffered a series of lopsided losses, and with many young athletes choosing to specialize in one sport and other activities competing for girls' time, the school decided to focus on developing young players instead of putting a team of freshman and sophomores on the court. \nStill, the school's decision was jarring at a time when college and professional women's basketball has been surging in popularity, partly due to the phenomenal success of WNBA Indiana Fever guard Clark, who set records at the University of Iowa.\nKansas State University women’s basketball coach Jeff Mittie said more viewers doesn't necessarily mean more players.\n“Certainly in college, all of our games are on TV, easy for people to find, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re playing the sport,” Mittie said. \"It just means they’re interested in watching it.”\nA declining trend\nSince Clark was born 22 years ago, participation in girls high school basketball has dropped nearly 20% and the sport has fallen from most popular to number four behind volleyball, soccer and track and field, which all have seen double-digit surges in participation, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.\nEven as the basketball numbers have dropped, total participation in high school sports has grown, with more than 3.4 million girls competing in high school sports last year.\nLosing takes a toll\nIn the past few years in Grand Island, Jim Ward watched every player on his oldest daughter's middle school team quit basketball in high school, either to focus on another sport like volleyball or wrestling or because they lost interest. During that time, the high school girls team was losing games by margins of 70 points or more. \nThe team lost 43 of its last 44 varsity games and has not won more than three games in a season since 2016-17, with its last winning season in 2009-10.\n“If you’re Grand Island going into Omaha facing some kids that are going to go D-1 (Division I) and you can only keep up with them for the first half of the first quarter, would you want to play longer?” asked Ward, who serves on the booster club board and has a daughter on the team in 10th grade.\nKelli Jefferies knows success is possible in Grand Island because she led the school to its only state championship in 1979 as a player and racked up 231 victories over 33 years as coach before stepping down in 2012. \nBut Jefferies said she understands the current struggles.\n“When you’re not really able to compete and be competitive, you can see why kids don’t want to do it anymore,” Jefferies said. “That’s not fun for everyone, for coaches and players and anyone involved.\"\nCostly competition\nThe problems in Grand Island and elsewhere run much deeper than a losing record.\nIn some communities it can be hard for girls to find opportunities to compete and learn the game when they are young. Many families can't afford to invest the thousands of dollars and countless hours required to play club basketball to prepare them to compete in high school, putting them behind in development.\nAs teams get competitive earlier and earlier, girls might quit the sport if they are cut in grade school.\nFamilies in Grand Island who want their kids to compete at the highest levels of club sports must drive about two hours twice a week to Lincoln or Omaha for practices and again on the weekends for tournaments if they are not traveling farther to other cities. \nCan the sport recover?\nGrand Island’s current coach, Kathryn Langrehr, works with middle schoolers and offers free basketball clinics at all the city’s elementary schools to help build a pipeline of players for the sport.\nBut rebuilding could be challenging, especially given the pressure on kids to specialize in just one sport.\n“It kind of speaks to the world that we’re living in with club sports and specialization of sports, where kids want to participate or are only able to participate in one activity,\" said Jon Dolliver, who oversees basketball at the Nebraska School Activities Association. \nVolleyball in particular grew tremendously as the sport became much more visible on television and social media and the U.S. emerged as a world power. \nThe sport is especially popular in Nebraska, where Creighton University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the state system's flagship campus, are ranked in the collegiate top 10. Nebraska fell short in the national semifinals on Friday. Last year, 92,003 people filled Nebraska's football stadium to watch a volleyball match, setting a world record for attendance at a women's sporting event.\nBrandon Traudt's daughter was a strong basketball player in middle school after growing up alongside her brother Isaac, who now plays for Creighton, but she always preferred volleyball. She will soon pursue that passion at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.\n“I think girls just naturally — especially in the state of Nebraska — gravitate towards volleyball,” Traudt said. “Volleyball is just very, very good in this state.”\nMaybe the popularity of the WNBA and players like Clark could change the trends, but Ward, the Grand Island dad, can envision an 8-year-old telling her parents she wants to play basketball only to be told there is no time for that with volleyball and dance.\n“I think the Caitlin Clark thing — it’s tough to say if this third grader sees it that she’s just going to quit volleyball and start playing basketball now. I don’t know,\" Ward said.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — JuJu Watkins scored 25 points and No. 7 USC recovered from blowing a 18-point lead in the second half to beat Paige Bueckers and fourth-ranked UConn 72-70 on Saturday night.\nThe game was a rematch of last season's Elite Eight contest that the Huskies won and featured two of the best players in women's college basketball with All-Americans Bueckers and Watkins. The pair guarded each other for most of the game.\nBueckers finished with 22 points.\nWith the game tied at 67, Watkins passed the ball to Rayah Marshall for a layup with 1:21 left to give USC the lead.\nAfter a miss by the Huskies, Watkins was fouled with 31 seconds left. She missed the first of two free throws as the ball sat on the rim for a few seconds before falling off. She made the second to give the Trojans (11-1) a 70-67 advantage. \nUConn (10-2), which trailed 51-33 in the third quarter before rallying, answered with a basket by Sarah Strong to get within one four seconds later.\nWatkins then hit two free throws with 19.5 seconds left to make it 72-69.\nThe Huskies had one last chance to tie when Strong was fouled shooting a 3-pointer with 5 seconds left. She made the first free throw, but missed the second. The freshman missed the third intentionally and UConn got the rebound. It eventually went out to Strong, whose desperation heave at the buzzer was off.\nTakeaways\nUSC: This was the Trojans' first test since losing to Notre Dame on Nov. 23. Now they face three ranked Big Ten teams in their next four games.\nUConn: This was the second top-10 team the Huskies have faced this season and they are now 0-2 after also falling to Notre Dame. \nKey moment\nEarlier in the third quarter, Watkins blocked Bueckers' shot then took the ball to the other end and scored after a going through her legs with UConn's star guarding her.\nKey stat\nA game after hitting a school-record 20 3-pointers, UConn was just 6 for 23 from behind the 3-point arc.\nUp next\nUSC: hosts Michigan on Dec. 29.\nUConn: hosts Providence on Dec. 29.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "subhead": "German authorities say they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged about the five people killed",
      "body": "\n\nMAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — German authorities said they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged on Sunday about the five people killed.\nAuthorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven’t publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy.\nAuthorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. The man described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. \nHe is being held in custody as authorities investigate him.\n\"This perpetrator acted in an unbelievably cruel and brutal manner — like an Islamist terrorist, although he was obviously ideologically an Islamophobe,” Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Sunday. \nThe suspect originally lived in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where he completed his specialist training in Stralsund and also came to the attention of authorities due to threatening criminal acts, the state interior minister, Christian Pegel, said Sunday.\nIn a dispute over the recognition of examination results, he threatened members of the state medical association with an act that would attract international attention, triggering an investigation and a search of his home, the dpa news agency reported, citing Pegel. No evidence was found of real preparations for an attack but a court found him guilty in 2013 of threatening an attack.\nThat was followed by other threats he made, Pegel said.\nThe head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch “appropriate investigative measures.”\n“The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,” said Münch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI.\nHe said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific.\nThe Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year.\n“This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,” the office said on X on Saturday. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details. \nThe Central Council of Ex-Muslims said in a statement that the suspect had “terrorized” them for years as it expressed shock at the attack.\n“He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,” said the statement. \nThe group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: “At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.”\nPolice in Magdeburg, the capital of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Sunday that those who died were four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy.\nAuthorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond.\nThe suspect was on Saturday evening brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on allegations of murder and attempted murder. He is facing a possible indictment. \nThe horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany makes it likely that migration will remain a key issue as the country heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. A deadly knife attack by a suspected Islamic extremist from Syria in Solingen in August pushed the issue to the top of the agenda, and led the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tighten border security measures.\nRight-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union’s migration policies and described it as a “terrorist act.”\nAt an annual press conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orbán insisted that “there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.”\n___\nGera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

      "body": "\n\nSURIN ISLANDS, Thailand (AP) — When Hook was a child, he started his days by jumping off the boat that his family lived on and into the ocean. By age 3, he could already swim and dive in shallow waters. His home was a kabang, a boat, that his family sailed in Thailand’s southern waters. The ocean was his backyard.\nNow Hook, whose full name is Suriyan Klathale, lives on land like the rest of his community, a people known as the Moken. The recollections of his childhood, which many Moken of his generation still have, are mostly just memories.\nThe community, a group of indigenous people from Thailand and Myanmar, came to worldwide attention for its members' understanding of waves when the Indian Ocean Tsunami struck in December 2004 and killed more than 200,000 people. The few tourists who happened to be on the islands inhabited by the Moken survived because locals knew when they saw the water recede that people needed to get to higher ground.\nToday, things are different and changing fast. This once free-sailing people have been grounded by powerful forces of change.\nHow do you hold onto tradition when everything is working against it?\nThe Moken are one of the various tribal groups and indigenous communities not formally recognized by the Thai government. For years, activists from these communities have tried to push for formal recognition with a bill that would help them hold on to traditions.\nBut as recently as October, the latest draft of this proposed bill, called the Protection and Promotion of Ethnic Groups’ Way of Life, was tabled by Parliament. The bill would legally guarantee these communities' basic rights, such as health care, education and land, as well as provide government support to preserve their ethnic identities. \nFor the Moken, the kabang and their way of living on the ocean are something they hope the law could help preserve. The wooden boat, with a distinctive curve that juts out from its bow and a pavilion set in the middle, is central to the Moken’s identity. “It’s like a lifetime of a person, of a family,\" Hook said. “In the past, we lived and died on that boat.”\nMultiple generations could live on a kabang, which were much bigger in the past. The parents would stay in the middle of the boat; their married children lived at the front until they built their own boat.\nTat, an elder in the Moken community who uses only one name, said that a Moken became an adult when he could build a boat. It meant he was capable of starting a family. \nToday, though, almost no one lives on a boat. Narumon Arunotai, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok who has worked with the Moken and other indigenous communities for decades, said the shift toward permanent dwelling on land had already started more than 40 years ago.\nIt was a gradual shift, driven both by stricter border controls as well as the inability to get the wood necessary to build the kabangs. Further, the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 destroyed many of the traditional boats. The change to dwelling on land has happened with other communities known colloquially as sea nomads in Thailand as well.\nThe Moken are scattered across an archipelago of some 800 islands on the coast of Myanmar and Thailand. In the days when they lived on boats, Moken stayed on land only during the monsoon season, which started around May. They’d stay on land until the winds shifted, usually around December, and then abandon their temporary homes for the sea. For food, they fished and foraged.\nMany of the older generation were born on boats and sailed regularly amongst the islands.\n“We could move freely without having to worry about the Myanmar government or the Thai government,\" said Tawan Klathale, Hook’s older brother, who was born on a boat. All Moken in Thailand use the surname Klathale, given to the community by one of Thailand’s former queens. \n“Back then,\" said the brother, who is known as Ngui, “there was no clear line to where is Myanmar and where is Thailand.”\nFreedoms began to constrict, and making boats became harder\n\nBut by the time Ngui and Hook were teenagers, they could no longer travel as freely between those islands. Many Moken started settling more permanently in the Surin Islands, off the Thai coast. Some came from Myanmar to Thailand, looking for jobs and safety from pirates. Hook’s family stayed ashore.\nThe parts of the community that stayed in Thailand found that the land they had always visited each season had become a national park by 1981. As a result, they could no longer cut down the large trees they needed to build their boats.\nTo make a kabang, one needs a good strong tree, at least 1 meter wide and 10 meters tall. The trunk needs to be straight and be free of defects. Over the course of months, men of the community would dig out the trunk and carve it into a boat’s hull, while also using fire to make the wood pliable and stretch it out. It was a communal thing, involving up to 10 people.\nNow, it’s difficult to gather enough people. Other men of the village would often be out working during the day. They did not have time to join and work together on a boat.\nNgui and other members of an informal group called Moken Pa Ti’ao, concerned they were losing the knowledge of boat-building, said they approached the park now and then across the years get a tree to make the boat. They were refused years ago by the chief of Mu Ko Surin National Park. The group hasn’t asked since.\nThe park allows them to cut down only small trees, said Ngui, who is also assistant to the village chief in Surin Island. “The restrictions has been like this as far as we can remember.”\nToday, the village in Surin only has one kabang, built by Tat and used mostly to ferry tourists and take children out on day trips. Hook, who lives on the mainland in Thailand, also has a kabang built with the funding of a private donor from Norway after a filmmaker made a documentary about his journey to make one such boat in 2014. But his kabang is built with planks of wood, rather than a single hollowed out tree. \nThey are among the few keen to remember the boats and other traditions. Tat says he has made sure to pass down what he knew to his children, from songs to boat building. \n“If my generation is gone, there would be just very few people left who know how to do these things,” Tat said.\nLearning about the ocean remains a priority\nTogether, Tat and Wilasinee Klathale, a teacher at the school on the island, also try to take village children out on the boats to teach them about the ocean as well as about music and dance.\n“It’s not in the curriculum, but I added them myself, because I could see that these things are going to be lost,” Wilasinee said.\nToday, young Moken are more worried about their livelihoods and finding jobs than how to build a boat. Most only make money during Thailand’s peak tourist season when the national park is open to tourists, from November to April, and have to live on that money for the rest of the year.\nBoyen Klathale, a young Moken man, said it’s difficult to find a job. On Surin, the opportunities are either with the national park or operating boats to take tourists out. Though it’s peak season, he wasn’t able to find a job this year, and he didn’t want to leave behind his family to find work on the mainland.\nThe Moken have asked for more fishing rights in the past, but were denied a further quota beyond the subsistence amount they’re allowed from the park. Ngui, the village chief’s assistant, said he hopes the Moken can sell the souvenirs they make to tourists all year around with help from the government.\nThe future holds some hope. In 2024, the Surin Islands National Park appointed a new chief, Kriengkrai Pohcharoen. In a shift, he said he was open to collaborating with the Moken on a kabang — as long as it was a tree that fell over on its own.\n“I think about how to improve their quality of life, and how they can sustainably live in nature,” he said. “I want them to have a good quality of life.”\nThe Moken are realistic about their permanent switch to land. These days, most prefer it. But some still remember the old ways — and an aquamarine bay filled with handmade kabangs.\n“The world is changing and that’s the way it is, if you ask me,” Ngui said. “I think everything is bound to be lost at some point, but I just want it to stay as long as possible.\"\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Will Howard threw two touchdown passes to freshman Jeremiah Smith and Ohio State routed Tennessee 42-17 on Saturday night in a first-round College Football Playoff game, setting up a New Year's Day rematch with No. 1 Oregon at the Rose Bowl.\nQuinshon Judkins and TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two touchdowns apiece as the Buckeyes (11-2) gave their fans an early Christmas present that should quiet some of the outcry following the devastating fourth straight loss to Michigan three weeks ago.\n“You could tell from the jump that they had a look in their eyes that they were going to win this game,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day said.\nHoward finished 24 for 29 for 311 yards, his second 300-yard game of the season. Smith had six catches for 103 yards, the sixth freshman to have over 100 receiving yards in a CFP game. Henderson had 10 carries for 80 yards.\n“We really put together a full, all-out performance, and I think that’s what we needed to do and what we needed to show,” Howard said.\nEighth-seeded Ohio State scored on its first three drives while forcing three straight Tennessee punts. The ninth-seeded Vols (10-3) finally got on the board with a second-quarter field goal and touchdown but couldn't generate anything in the second half until getting a meaningless touchdown late in the game. \n″We didn’t play the way we needed to, we didn’t play well enough, and we didn’t coach well enough,\" Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said.\n“They made some plays — that’s going to happen against a good team, but what we didn’t do is to come back and find a way to get back on the right side of it, and that’s offensively and defensively.\"\nThe 473 yards gained by Ohio State was the most surrendered by the Tennessee defense all season.\nThe game-time temperature was 25 degrees and dropping in the first college football game played in December in 102-year-old Ohio Stadium. \nTakeaways\n\nTennessee: Star running back Dylan Sampson was hampered by a hamstring injury and had just two carries for 6 yards. Receivers Squirrel White and Dont'e Thorton Jr. also were banged up. limiting the Vols' offense. \nOhio State: The Buckeyes did what they didn't do against Michigan: get the ball on the boundary, throw deep to their most explosive players while establishing a run game.\n“We called this game more aggressively,” Day said. “There’s no question about that.”\nDefense cranks it up\nThe Buckeyes’ defense is statistically the best in the nation and certainly looked like it against Tennessee. The front dogged quarterback Nico Iamaleava and sacked him four times, twice by JT Tuimoloau. The Vols finished with 256 yards, but a big chunk of that came late when the game was already out of reach. They managed just 3.7 yards per play.\nIamaleava finished just 14 for 31 for 104 yards, his lowest total of the season. He rushed a career-high 20 times for 47 yards.\n“I got after them at half time and challenged them, because I knew the way the game was going, as long as we did our job everything was going to turn out all right,” Ohio State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles said. “So, I thought we came out strong in the second half.”\nTennessee turns out\nThere was a large mix of Tennessee orange in the Ohio Stadium crowd of over 104,000, by far biggest fan turnout by an Ohio State opponent in recent memory. Vols fans certainly seemed to get their hands on more than the 3,500 tickets allotted to the school by the NCAA.\nUp next\nThe Buckeyes advance to a second-round game against Oregon in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. They lost to the Ducks 32-31 on Oct. 12.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "subhead": "Officials say four women and a 9-year-old boy were killed when a man drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg",
      "body": "\n\nMAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Four women and a 9-year-old boy were killed and 200 people were injured when a man drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg — an attack that has left Germans mourning the victims and with a shaken sense of security.\nHow did the attack unfold? \nAt first, Thi Linh Chi Nguyen thought the loud bangs were fireworks. The 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam, whose salon is near the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard the noise just after 7 p.m. on Friday. Then she saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car.\nThe woman recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at a tram stop where the suspect was arrested.\nThe Christmas market was surrounded by concrete barriers designed to prevent attacks, but there was a gap left for emergency access, wide enough for a car to speed through.\nThe market area reopened Sunday, and residents walked slowly amid the shuttered food, drink and craft stands. Nearby, people stopped to light candles or leave flowers at a growing makeshift memorial.\nWho are the victims?\nPolice say the dead are four women, aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, and a boy, aged 9. He was named as André Gleissner by fire department officials in the Elm-Asse region west of Magdeburg, where he was a member of the children’s fire brigade.\nAuthorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond.\nWho is the suspect in the attack?\nProsecutors said the suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor, is under investigation on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. In a closed-door hearing on Saturday evening, a judge ordered that he be kept in custody pending a possible indictment.\nSeveral German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. He has lived in Germany since 2006, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg.\nThe suspect's X account describes him as a former Muslim. It is filled with tweets and retweets focusing on anti-Islam themes and criticism of the religion, while sharing congratulatory notes to Muslims who left the faith. He was critical of German authorities, saying they had failed to do enough to combat the “Islamification of Europe.” He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. \nWhat was the motive?\nInvestigators are analyzing the suspect's computers, mobile devices and other evidence, trying to understand what motivated him to drive his black BMW into a crowd in the eastern German city. Prosecutors said the motive may have been “dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi refugees in Germany.”\nIntelligence agencies say that increasingly they are seeing attackers with a confusing mix of beliefs and motivations. The head of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency MI5, Ken McCallum, said in October that “straightforward labels like ‘Islamist terrorism’ or ‘extreme right-wing’ don’t fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see.”\nThere are unanswered questions about what the authorities knew about the suspect. The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said the agency — Germany's equivalent of the FBI — received a warning from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, but that the information was unspecific.\nMünch said the suspect “published a huge number of posts on the internet,” was in contact with various authorities and “made insults and even threats” — but was not known to be violent.\nGermany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also acknowledged it had received a warning about the suspect last year.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is facing criticism about security lapses that allowed the attack to happen, and was heckled by some bystanders during a visit to Magdeburg on Saturday. \nA string of attacks\nThe violence shocked all of Germany, prompting several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution, and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but increased the police presence.\nGermany has suffered several extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others.\nThose attacks have led cities to beef up security at Christmas markets and other events.\nThe horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany makes it likely that migration will remain a key issue as Germans head toward an early election on Feb. 23.\nIt is the latest in a string of incidents around the world in which vehicles have been used as weapons by jihadi attackers, far-right extremists and others whose motives were unclear. \n\n",

      "subhead": "Manchester City’s stunning slump has deepened after losing at Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League",
      "body": "\n\nManchester City’s stunning slump deepened after losing to Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday.\nGoals from Jhon Duran and Morgan Rogers at Villa Park consigned the four-time defending champion to a ninth defeat in 12 games in a season that is unravelling. Pep Guardiola’s team has won just once during that run.\n“We don’t have a defense for the results. They are not good,” Guardiola said.\nThird-placed Arsenal closed the gap on league leader Liverpool to three points with a 5-1 win at Crystal Palace, but has played two games more.\nCity dropped to sixth in the standings, nine points below Liverpool, and has played two games more.\n“It’s about what I can do with my people to get the results back and continue,” Guardiola said. “If there is a moment that I cannot overthink, it is right now. Try to be simple, stick to my principles and give certainty to the team.”\nTitle hopes fading\nAfter winning six titles in seven years and an unprecedented four in a row, City’s remarkable fall shows little sign of stopping. Guardiola admitted last week he had not been good enough to turn his team’s form around.\nCity was without a win in any of its last eight away games in all competitions. While it looks unlikely to win a fifth straight title, a place in the top four and Champions League qualification could also be in jeopardy after fourth-placed Nottingham Forest won at Brentford 2-0 to move four points clear of City.\nOnly once under Guardiola has City managed to win the title when losing six times in the league. That was in 2021, when it lost two of its last three games, having already been confirmed as the champion.\nCity lost nine times when Liverpool won the title in 2020, but its sixth defeat didn’t come until February. Guardiola also lost six times in his first season in English soccer in 2016-17 and City finished third.\nThe latest defeat could have been even more emphatic from a dominant Villa, which moved up to fifth.\nDuran scored his sixth goal in as many starts in the 16th minute from Rogers’ assist. Duran had a goal disallowed for offside in the second half and Rogers hit the post before doubling Villa’s lead in the 65th.\nPhil Foden pulled a goal back for City in stoppage time, but it wasn’t enough to spark a late comeback.\n“We have to stay positive, even though it’s difficult, and we have to keep working hard,” City striker Erling Haaland said.\nJesus streak\nIt’s five goals in a week for Gabriel Jesus against Crystal Palace.\nAfter scoring a hat trick in Arsenal’s 3-2 comeback win against Palace in the English League Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday, the Brazil striker hit another two goals when the teams met again on Saturday.\nGoing into Wednesday’s game, Jesus had only scored once for Arsenal since the end of January.\nJesus struck twice in a frantic start at Selhurst Park. He opened the scoring in the sixth, with Ismaila Sarr leveling five minutes later.\nJesus restored Arsenal’s lead in the 14th and was denied back-to-back hat tricks when hitting the post and then having another close range effort saved by Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson.\nKai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice also scored for Arsenal. \nForest flying high\nIf City’s demise is a surprise story of the season, so is Forest’s rise.\nAfter battling relegation for much of last term, Forest is in contention to qualify for the Champions League and possibly more.\nFacing a Brentford team that was unbeaten at home, goals from Ola Aina and Anthony Elanga secured another statement win on the road for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, having already won at Anfield and Old Trafford this year.\nIsak treble\nAlexander Isak hit a hat trick in Newcastle’s 4-0 win at Ipswich.\nThe Sweden international, who has 10 goals in his last 11 games, wrapped up his treble inside 54 minutes at Portman Road, including one in the opening minute. Jacob Murphy also scored.\nBrighton was 1-0 up at West Ham through Mats Wieffer, but Mohammed Kudus levelled for the draw.\n___\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nKINSHASA, Congo (AP) — A ferry overloaded with people returning home for Christmas capsized on the Busira River in northeastern Congo, leaving 38 people confirmed dead and over 100 others missing, officials and eyewitnesses said Saturday. Twenty people have been rescued so far. \nThe sinking of the ferry late Friday came less than four days after another boat capsized in the country's northeast, killing 25 people.\nThe ferry was traveling as part of a convoy of other vessels and the passengers were primarily merchants returning home for Christmas, said Joseph Joseph Kangolingoli, the mayor of Ingende, the last town on the river before the site of the accident. \nAccording to Ingende resident Ndolo Kaddy, the ferry contained “more than 400 people because it made two ports, Ingende and Loolo, on the way to Boende, so there is reason to believe there were more deaths.”\nCongolese officials have often warned against overloading boats and vowed to punish those violating safety measures on rivers. However, in remote areas many people cannot afford public transportation on the few available roads.\nAt least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country’s east while 80 lost their lives in a similar accident near Kinshasa in June.\nThe latest accident prompted anger at the government for not equipping the convoy with flotation devices.\nNesty Bonina, a member of the local government and a prominent figure in Mbandaka, the capital of the Equateur province where the ferry sank, condemned authorities for not properly handling the recent sinkings.\n“How can a ship navigate at night under the watchful eye of river service agents? And now we’re recording over a hundred deaths,” said Bonina. \nThe capsizing of overloaded boats is becoming increasingly frequent in this central African nation as more people are giving up the few available roads in favor of wooden vessels crumbling under the weight of passengers and their goods for security reasons.\nThe roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes. \n\n",

      "body": "\n\nMatt Rempe of the New York Rangers has been offered an in-person hearing with the NHL’s Department of Player Safety to discuss his boarding and elbowing of Dallas Stars defenseman Miro Heiskanen.\nThe in-person hearing, which can be held via Zoom as opposed to a phone call, allows senior vice president of player safety George Parros and his department to suspend Rempe for six or more games. The time and date of the hearing is to be determined, the league said Saturday.\nRempe, a 6-foot-8 forward, became a fan favorite last season in his rookie year for fighting some of the toughest veteran big men in a throwback to vintage enforcers who largely have disappeared from hockey. But he also ran afoul of the rules, getting ejected twice and receiving a four-game suspension for one of those situations: an elbow to the head of New Jersey’s Jonas Siegenthaler.\nThat history factors in on the length of the suspension, along with injury and intent on the play that occurred with 13 minutes left in the third period Friday night. Heiskanen returned to skate four more shifts after going through concussion protocol, according to Stars coach Peter DeBoer, who called it a dangerous hit.\nThe game at Dallas was Rempe’s first back in the NHL after being recalled from the minors following the Rangers' trade of winger Kaapo Kakko to Seattle. Rempe spent the summer training to become a better fighter but also worked to become a better all-around player.\nNow 22, Rempe has spent the vast majority of the season with Hartford of the American Hockey League. He played less than six minutes in the 3-1 win against the Stars, after which Rangers coach Peter Laviolette told reporters he thought Rempe “had a big impact on the game.”\n“I’d like to stay away from the 5-minute major, but he’s doing his best to hit bodies and make a difference in the game,” Laviolette said. \"Our guys really rallied around that at the end.”\n___\nAP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nSuchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.\nBalaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.\n“We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir’s loved ones during this difficult time,” said a statement from OpenAI.\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said “appeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.” The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.\nHis parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a “happy, smart and brave young man” who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends. \nBalaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.\n“Suchir’s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn’t have succeeded without him,” said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.\n“He had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,” Schulman wrote. “He’d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.”\nBalaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement. \nHe first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.\nHe later told The Associated Press he would “try to testify” in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the “most serious.” Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have “unique and relevant documents” supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement. \nHis records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.\n“It doesn’t feel right to be training on people’s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,” Balaji told the AP in late October. “I don’t think you should be able to do that. I don’t think you are able to do that legally.”\nHe told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.\nBut of the “bag of issues” he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was “actually possible to do something about.”\nHe acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said “they will have to change and it’s a matter of time.”\nHe had not been deposed and it’s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.\nSchulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji’s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.\nSchulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence “was right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.” The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring “some more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,” Schulman said.\nBalaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino. \n—————-\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

      "subhead": "One of the most turbulent sessions of Congress in the modern era is about to make way for the next one",
      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — One of the most turbulent sessions of Congress in the modern era is about to make way for the next one.\nMidnight passage of the government shutdown package put in sharp focus the political fault lines emerging in Washington, as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., fights for his job and Republicans sweep into control of the House and Senate in the new year.\nIt took bipartisan votes, Republicans and Democrats, to keep government running for a few more months and provide some $100 billion for disaster aid. Working together, the parties showed the House and Senate can still function, at times, to accomplish the basics of governing.\n“After a chaotic few days in the House, it’s good news that the bipartisan approach in the end prevailed,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat. \"It’s a good lesson for next year. Both sides have to work together.”\nBut next year, with big GOP promises to cut taxes and slash spending, while also pumping in new money to fund Trump’s border security and deportation operations, Republicans intend to go it alone.\n“We are set up for a big and important new start in January,” Johnson said. “We can’t wait to get started.”\nFirst, though, Johnson needs to be sure he has a job.\nJohnson's shaky grip on the gravel\nThe first vote of the new House, when lawmakers are sworn in on Jan. 3, is on electing a speaker. That leaves Johnson little time to calm the criticism after facing stark blowback over his management of the government shutdown fight.\nJohnson was never the House Republicans’ top choice for the speaker’s office but he emerged when they couldn’t agree on a replacement once they kicked out the last speaker, Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\nKeeping the gavel is only becoming more difficult. The government shutdown saga exposed the limits of Johnson's influence over his majority, and Trump, when his first two funding plans collapsed. It's unclear if Johnson will have enough support from his ranks.\n“It’s always the big question, right?” said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., among the handful of mainly fiscal conservatives who cast their votes to oust McCarthy. “Ultimately, and let’s be honest, that’s going to be — a large portion of that — will be up to Donald J. Trump.” \nAnd yet, Johnson was able to buy time, convincing Trump he would meet the president-elect’s demands to raise the debt limit in the new year. Johnson has worked hard to stay close to Trump — dashing to Mar-a-Lago and joining him ringside at Madison Square Garden — and the investment shows.\nJohnson insisted Trump was “certainly happy” with the final deal.\n“The Speaker did a good job here, given the circumstances,” posted Trump ally Elon Musk, who has been mentioned as a potential replacement, since the speaker does not need to be a member of Congress.\nJohnson has no votes to spare, having actually lost House seats in the fall election, shrinking his majority. Democrats will oppose him with their own speaker candidate, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n“Clearly, Johnson is not up to the task,” said Trump ally and podcast provocateur Steven Bannon at a conservative conference. \"He doesn’t have what we call the right stuff — that combination of guts and moxie and savvy and toughness.”\nMusk emerges as a power broker on Capitol Hill\nThe world's richest man is fast becoming Capitol Hill's most feared influencer. \nMusk intervened in the government shutdown debate using the enormous power of his social media platform, X, to ravage Johnson's original 1,500-page bipartisan bill, swiftly tearing it down.\nIn post after post, hour after hour, Musk unleashed his criticisms, and sometimes inaccurate claims, sending his army of online followers to figuratively flood the Capitol, warning that if lawmakers voted for it he would take them on with primary elections. His vast wealth and America PAC backed up his threats.\n“Kill the bill,” Musk demanded.\nMusk had his moment, but also launched a new one for himself.\nDemocrat after Democrat, and at least one Republican, turned on Musk, seeing not a benevolent billionaire wading into the political process, but a symbol of extreme U.S. wealth and power run amok.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, decried the health care and other bipartisan provisions stripped from the bill to scale it back as Musk had demanded.\n“The precedent that has been set today in Congress should upset every American,” Sanders said in a statement announcing his refusal to support the final bill. He voted against it.\n“It appears that from now on no major legislation can be passed without the approval of the wealthiest person in this country,” Sanders said. “That’s not democracy, that’s oligarchy.”\nTrump runs the GOP but not the deficit hawks\nOne of the most outspoken conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus is Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who led the charge against Trump’s demand for a debt limit hike as part of the government shutdown package.\nTrump tried to bully and blister Roy into submission. It didn’t work.\n“The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual,” Trump posted on social media.\nTrump suggested there should be a primary challenge against Roy. “Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,\" he said.\nRoy, though, has his own popular following as a leading deficit hawk. He held his own, ignoring Trump’s attack and admonishing his colleagues not to go along with Trump's demand to boost the debt ceiling and allow more borrowing.\n“You go out and campaign, say you’re going to balance the budget, and then you come in here,” he shouted, choking up at times during the floor debate. “It’s embarrassing.”\nIn the end, 38 House Republicans including Roy sided with Democrats and tanked Trump’s debt ceiling increase.\nThe next debt limit fight is coming soon\nThe failure of Trump's preferred spending bill, with the debt limit increase, signals problems ahead.\nRepublicans will have to raise the debt ceiling in the first half of the year — likely by early summer according to some estimates — and there will be a large price to pay. It is leverage in any policy talks.\nAs part of the deal Johnson made to pass the temporary government funding package, he struck a “gentlemen's agreement” behind closed doors with his fellow Republicans ahead of Friday's vote.\nThe House Republicans agreed to slash some $2.5 trillion from federal spending over the next decade as part of the emerging tax cut bill, which is an enormous sum in federal budgeting, in exchange for boosting the debt limit, as will need to happen to avoid a federal default.\nBurchett, for one, had no interest in any such deals.\n“I said, 'This ain’t no place for gentlemen,'” he said. “That's when I yelled out, ‘You’re losing me’.”\nTrump may have lost the deficit hawks on the vote, but not his own political sway on Capitol Hill.\n“He’s still strong,” Burchett said. “People still love him back home. And that’s all that really matters.”\n___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.\n\n",

According to Peskov, the talks would focus on “the international situation” and Russian natural gas deliveries. \nVisits and phone calls from European leaders to Putin have been rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, although Hungary’s PM Viktor Orban visited Russia in July. Orban’s visit drew condemnation from Kyiv and European leaders\n\n",

      "subhead": "Approximately 1 million taxpayers will automatically receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS in the coming weeks",
      "body": "\n\nApproximately 1 million taxpayers will automatically receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS in the coming weeks. The money will be directly deposited into eligible people's bank accounts or sent in the mail by a paper check. \nThe IRS said it's distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. People who missed one of the COVID stimulus payments or had received less than the full amount were able to claim the credit. But the IRS on Friday said it discovered many eligible taxpayers hadn't done so.\n“Looking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.\nHere's more about the unexpected cash this group of taxpayers will soon receive:\nWhat's the likelihood I'll receive a check? \nSorry, it's probably pretty low. The IRS said most taxpayers eligible for the federal stimulus payments, formally known as Economic Impact Payments, have already received them.\nThe special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit.\nHow will this work?\nEligible taxpayers don't have to take any action. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January 2025. They'll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file. \nPayments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated.\nIRS plans to send separate letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment.\nWhat if I haven't filed my 2021 tax return yet?\nYou still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to IRS.\nHow many rounds of COVID stimulus payments were there? \nThere were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents. \nIn March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act.\n\n",

      "subhead": "It is just about time to say goodbye, once and for all, to the amateur athlete in college sports",
      "body": "\n\nWhen the page turns on 2024, it will be time to say goodbye, once and for all, to the amateur athlete in college sports.\nIn theory, the concept held on stubbornly via the quaint and now all-but-dead notion that student-athletes played only for pride, a scholarship and some meal money.\nIn practice, the amateurs have been disappearing for years, washed away by the steady millions, now billions, that have flowed into college athletics, mostly through football and basketball both through legitimate and illicit means.\nIn the coming year, the last vestiges of amateur college sports are expected to officially sputter out — the final step of a journey that has felt inevitable since 2021. That's when the Supreme Court laid the foundation for paying college players in exchange for promotions — on social media, TV, video games, you name it — featuring their name, image or likeness (NIL).\nThe changes have come in spasms so far, not always well thought out, not always fair and not regulated by any single entity like the NCAA or federal government, but rather by a collection of state laws, along with rules at individual schools and the leagues in which they play.\nBut on April 7, the day final approval is expected for the landmark, $2.8 billion lawsuit settlement that lays the foundation for players to receive money directly from their schools, what was once considered anathema to the entire concept of college sports will become the norm.\nDavid Schnase, the NCAA’s vice president for academic and membership affairs, acknowledges that maintaining the unique essence of college sports is a challenge in the shifting landscape.\n“You can use the word ‘pro,’ you can use the word ‘amateur,’ you can attach whatever moniker you want to it, but those are just labels,” Schnase said. “It’s much less about labels and more about experiences and circumstances. Circumstances are different today than they were last year and they are likely going to be different in the foreseeable future.”\nDo athletes get rich off these new deals?\nFew would argue that college athletes should get something back for the billions they help produce in TV and ticket revenue, merchandise sales and the like.\nBut is everyone going to cash in? Are college players really getting rich?\nRecent headlines suggest top quarterback recruit Bryce Underwood was lured to Michigan thanks to funding from billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and that a top basketball recruit, A.J. Dybantsa, is heading to BYU — not a hoops powerhouse — for the reported price of $7 million.\nFor every Underwood or Dybantsa, though, there are even more Matthew Slukas and Beau Pribulas.\nSluka's agent says his son agreed to play quarterback at UNLV after a promise of receiving $100,000 and quit three games into the season after the checks never came.\nPribula was the backup quarterback at Penn State who abruptly entered the transfer portal earlier this month, choosing the college version of free agency over a chance to play with the Nittany Lions in the College Football Playoff. He's not the only one hitting the portal in hopes of getting rich before new regulations related to the NCAA settlement take effect.\n“We’ve got problems in college football,” Penn State coach James Franklin said.\nThe settlement will overhaul the current system. Currently, players receive money via third-party collectives that are booster-funded groups affiliated with individual schools. Coming up fast: the schools paying the athletes directly — the term often used here is “revenue sharing” — with collectives still an option, but not the only one.\n“It's going to be more transparent,” said Jeff Kessler, the plaintiffs' attorney and antitrust veteran who helped shape the settlement. “If anything, having the schools handling all the payments is only going to improve the system.”\nThe NCAA has started collecting data about NIL payments, which date to July 2021. Its first set of numbers, which includes data from more than 140 schools across more than 40 sports in 2024, show a bracing disconnect between have and have-nots.\nFor instance, average earnings for football and men's and women's basketball players is nearly $38,000. But the median earning — the middle number among all the data points on the list — is only $1,328, a sign of how much the biggest contracts skew the average.\nWomen make vastly less than men\nThe statistics also show a vast difference in earnings between men and women, an issue that could impact schools' ability to comply with Title IX. That 1972 law requires schools to provide equal athletic scholarships and financial aid but not necessarily that they spend the same dollar amount on men and women. Heading into 2025, there is no clarity on how this issue will play out.\nRegardless, the numbers are jarring. The NCAA data set shows the average earnings for women in 16 sports was $8,624, compared with $33,321 for men in 11 sports. Men,'s basketball players averaged $56,000 compared with $11,500 for women.\nPaying players could cost some and benefit others\nThe biggest losers from this move toward a professional model could be all the swimmers and wrestlers and field hockey players — the athletes in the so-called non-revenue sports whose programs also happen to serve as the backbone of the U.S. Olympic team.\nOnly a tiny percentage of those athletes are getting rich, and now that universities have to use revenue to pay the most sought-after players in their athletic programs, there could be cuts to the smaller sports.\nAlso, someone's going to have backfill the revenue that will now go to the players. Well-heeled donors like Ellison are not around for every school, nor have private equity firms started sending money.\nThe average fan will have to pony up, and the last six months have seen dozens if not hundreds of athletic directors begging alumni for money and warning them of changes ahead. Already there are schools placing surcharges on tickets or concessions.\nHow will fans respond to a more transactional model of college sports?\n“I don't know that fans have this really great love for the idea of 100% pure amateurism,” said Nels Popp, a University of North Carolina sports business professor. “I think what they care about is the colors and the logos and the brand. I don't know that it matters to them if the players are making a little bit of money or a lot of money. They've been making money for the last couple years, and I don't know that that's making fans really back off.”\nOlympics got rid of ‘amateurs’ and turned into a multibillion-dollar industry\nThe last time amateurism came under such assault was in the 1980s, when the Olympics unwound the final remnants of pretending the vast majority of their athletes were anything other than full-time professionals.\nThe transformation was tinged with a note of honesty: The people putting on the show should reap some benefits from it. Even 40 years later, there's an good argument they remain underpaid.\nThe contours of the same debate are shaping up in college sports.\nAthletes are pushing for a players’ association that would add more transparency to a business that, even with the changes coming, is still largely dictated by the schools.\nThe NCAA, while acceding to the need to pay the players, wants nothing to do with turning them into actual employees of the schools they play for. It's an expensive prospect that is winding its way through the legal system via lawsuits and labor hearings that many in college sports are desperate to avoid for fear it will push the entire industry off the financial cliff.\nAmong the few things everyone agrees on is that things aren't going back to a time when athletes pretended to play for pride while the money moved under tables and through shadows. And that this, in fact, could only be the start, not the end, of the transformation of college sports.\n“At some point, I think people might have to understand that maybe college athletes don't go to college anymore,” Popp said. “Or maybe they don't go to class during the season. There could be more radical changes, and as long as they're wearing the right logo and the right colors, I'm not sure that fans really care.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "body": "\n\nMAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — When Cyclone Chido ravaged Mayotte’s fragile infrastructure, it also exposed deep-seated tensions between the island’s residents and its large migrant population. \nThousands of people who have entered the island illegally bore the brunt of the storm that tore through the Indian Ocean archipelago — France's poorest territory. Authorities in Mayotte said many migrants avoided emergency shelters out of fear of deportation, leaving themselves and the precarious shantytowns they inhabit even more vulnerable to the devastation. \nMeanwhile, anger simmered among residents who accused the government of diverting the island’s already scarce resources to migrants at their expense.\n“We are the legitimate population of this island,” said Amada Salime. Standing in the rubble of his home on Saturday, he added, “If there is help from the government — water or something to eat or money to make houses — Mahorais people will not have it. Immigrants are more numerous than us, and we will be left behind.”\nMayotte, a French department located between Madagascar and mainland Africa, has a population of 320,000. French authorities have estimated another 100,000 migrants also live there, most of whom have arrived from the nearby Comoros Islands, just 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.\nThe island’s fragile public services, designed for a much smaller population, are buckling under the strain. According to the French statistics agency INSEE, around three-quarters of Mayotte’s population live in poverty, with a median annual disposable income just one-eighth that of the Paris metropolitan area.\n“The problems of Mayotte cannot be solved without addressing illegal immigration,” French President Emmanuel Macron said during his testy visit this week, acknowledging the challenges posed by the island’s rapid population growth. “Despite the state’s investments, migratory pressure has made everything explode,” he added.\nPeople living in Mayotte for decades worry about a crackdown \nThe cyclone further exacerbated the island’s issues after destroying homes, schools and infrastructure. Though the official death toll remains 35, authorities say that any estimates are likely major undercounts, with hundreds feared dead. \nThe migrants’ shantytowns, known as “bangas,” have long been an issue in Mayotte. “Can we solve the issue of shantytowns today? The answer is no. We will address it during the stabilization and rebuilding phase,” Macron said.\nFor many migrants, like Nazca Antoiy, a Comorian who has lived in Mayotte for a decade, the cyclone has heightened fears of displacement.\n“I heard that people were told not to reconstruct new houses. So we need to worry about that,” she said, reflecting a widespread concern that authorities may use the disaster to expedite demolitions of informal settlements.\nSuch concerns are not unfounded. Last year, France launched Operation Wuambushu, a controversial campaign to demolish shantytowns and deport migrants who entered illegally. Macron hinted that similar policies could resume but stressed reconstruction efforts would take precedence.\nThe storm has left many residents struggling to meet basic needs.\nA hotspot for migrants \n“I can’t take it anymore. Just to have water is complicated,” said Fatima, a 46-year-old mother of five whose family has been without clean water since the storm ravaged Mayotte last weekend. Fatima, who only gave her first name because her family is known locally, also said she felt the island could not support the current population, let alone more.\nMost migrants have family links in Mayotte and speak the same language. They seek a better life on the island rather than aiming to reach the European continent.\nMayotte’s geopolitical position has long made it a hotspot for migration. While the island voted to remain French in referendums held in 1974 and 1976, neighboring Comoros has never recognized its sovereignty and continues to claim the archipelago as its own. This unresolved dispute has fueled waves of migration, with thousands risking perilous sea crossings each year.\nOutgoing French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently reignited the debate, describing the situation in Mayotte as a “war,” earlier this week. Retailleau proposed stricter measures, including using drones and naval patrols to block further arrivals. “We must be much tougher on the Comoros,” he said, accusing the neighboring government of allowing migrants to leave its shores unchecked.\nRetailleau’s calls to “change the rules” include proposals to restrict birthright citizenship in Mayotte, a policy already tightened in 2018 to require proof that at least one parent had been a legal resident for more than three months. Critics argue that these measures only deepen Mayotte’s divisions without addressing the root causes of migration.\nA 2023 parliamentary report cited in French media warned that the island was a “ticking time bomb,” while suggesting redistributing part of Mayotte’s migrant population to mainland France — a proposal unlikely to gain widespread support.\n___\nAdamson reported from Paris.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children",
      "body": "\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children. Families are struggling during the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\nAt least 35 children were killed in southwestern Oyo state on Wednesday. And on Saturday, 22 people died in southeastern Anambra state while 10 died in the capital, Abuja, where more than 1,000 people had gathered at a church to receive clothes and food.\nHere's why people in Africa's most populous country are risking their lives for holiday donations.\nInflation at a 28-year high\n“There is hunger in this Nigeria. Every Nigerian needs food,” one woman, in tears, told the local Arise television after the stampede in Abuja.\nThe economic crisis is blamed on the government’s policies to save money and attract investors, which have contributed to pushing the inflation rate to a 28-year high of 34.6%. Meanwhile the naira currency languishes at record lows against the dollar.\nAt least 63% of Nigeria's more than 210 million people population is poor, according to the government's statistics office. The government has struggled to create jobs. And when people gather to protest hardship, security forces are quick to clamp down. In August, more than 20 people were shot dead by security forces during nationwide protests.\n“The average Nigerian has seen food go out of their reach,” said Cheta Nwanze, managing partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm. In 2022, the firm found that about 97% of Nigerians spend up to 63% of their income on food, but that share must have grown since then, he said.\nSome of those who died in Abuja had waited overnight outside the church in cold weather for the chance to enter early, according to Loveth Inyang, a witness who rescued a baby from the crush.\nSecurity is costly, too\nDeadly stampedes are not new in Nigeria and are often caused by lack of adherence to public safety measures. But analysts say people's desperation to survive is making crowd control more difficult.\nAccounts from witnesses and police in Abuja and Anambra showed that the stampedes occurred before the events started as people tried to secure prime positions.\nIn Abuja, the church was forced to cancel the event, leaving bags of rice and clothing items inside.\nOrganizers of such charity events often do not consider security a priority, said Ademola Adetuberu, who runs the Abuja-based Barricade Executive Protection security firm.\nMeanwhile, the number of events is increasing as philanthropists and organizations try to meet the growing demand for food.\n“If organizers of such events brainstorm more, get professionals to advise them and have a budget for security, this can be prevented,” Adetuberu said.\nHow authorities are responding\nNigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has asked authorities to no longer tolerate “operational lapses” by organizers of such events, while police have made it mandatory for organizers to get prior permission before hosting them.\nBut such commitments are not new and usually difficult to enforce, analysts said.\n“People’s incomes have been squeezed through the entire year. When they hear somewhere that food is being distributed, their natural instinct is to go,\" Nwanze said. “Add this to our notoriously poor queue culture and you have the perfect storm that will lead to such a stampede.”\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nFor those who dozed through it, or flipped to more compelling fare in the NFL, here's a brief recap of the rollout of the much-anticipated College Football Playoff.\nAverage final score: Winners 36, Losers 17.\nIn four games, not a single one was closer than a 10-point margin, and even that one felt worse.\nThis bold, new experiment was supposed to bring more programs from more parts of the country into the loop of a largely regional sport that had been dominated by about a half-dozen teams for the last decade.\nInstead, it will take another 10 days to find out if “more” really means more — or if more just means a few weeks of what we just saw before arriving at what we had before — a group of four contenders battling it out for a title that only they had any realistic chance to win.\nOne part that did feel like a success was that the stands were full in all four stadiums — at Texas, Notre Dame, Penn State and Ohio State.\n“I think college football got this one right,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said after the Longhorns beat Clemson 38-24 in front of a packed house in what turned out to be the weekend's most compelling game. “As much as we critique some of the things that are happening in our game right now, this idea of a home playoff game with this 12-team format, this was pretty special.”\nThe TV ratings will paint a fuller picture, especially of the decision to run directly against two NFL games, both of which came down to the fourth quarter.\nCould the quarterfinals bring more of the same?\nThe quarterfinals come over the New Year's holiday, where we'll get more clarity not only about who might win the title, but whether the CFP as it is structured is as good as it can be. The matchups (and issues involved in all of them):\nFiesta Bowl, Dec. 31, No. 6 Penn State vs. No. 3 Boise State: The rules called for the four highest-ranked conference champions to receive first-round byes, and so you get this. Penn State is the worse seed but is a 10 1/2-point favorite over the Mountain West Conference champions. Boise State has the nation's leading rusher in Ashton Jeanty. Penn State is probably bigger and faster at every other position.\nPeach Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 5 Texas vs. No. 4 Arizona State: See above for thoughts about byes, potential mismatches and pairings that might have made more sense had they come earlier. Texas is a 13 1/2-point favorite. But, the Sun Devils of the Big 12 are the closest thing this tournament has to a Cinderella — in win-or-you're-done territory since Nov. 2, and with a pair of eminently entertaining players in quarterback Sam Leavitt and running back Cam Skattebo.\nRose Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 8 Ohio State vs. No. 1 Oregon: Had the rule-makers chosen to reseed the bracket after the first round to give Oregon a game against the highest-seeded team left, this would have been the matchup anyway. But do we really want a rematch of possibly the best game in college football this season — Oregon's 32-31 win over Ohio State in October — in the quarterfinals?\nSugar Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 7 Notre Dame at No. 2 Georgia: Reports are that Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck might be done for the season after hurting his elbow in the SEC title game. The selection committee was supposed to consider injuries in its rankings, but probably didn't have enough information to make an informed decision at the time. Long ago, in a galaxy far away, Georgia beat Notre Dame in the 1981 Sugar Bowl to capture its second national title.\nThe transfer portal chips away at rosters\nThe transfer portal will (thankfully?) close Dec. 28, meaning the steady trickle of departures from teams with title hopes will not infiltrate the headlines as we head into football's elite eight.\nBut this entire setup is awkward. Arizona State lost 12 players to the portal after it opened on Dec. 9. Tennessee lost 11. The highest-profile departure was Penn State backup quarterback Beau Pribula. Whether these players would've been on the field much (they wouldn't, which is probably why some left) almost seems beside the point.\nFor decades, playing to win a championship was thought to be the north star for any elite athlete. Or so we thought. There is a lot of money available, and it's also not hard to blame a player for trying to max out his earning potential in the new world of college football endorsements.\n“I think everybody that follows the sport understands that it’s a unique time of year,” Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said. “I’m not in charge of that. Do I think they need to find a way to go through all the processes that they have right now, or things that are in the game but find a better calendar for it? Yeah, I think that would be best for the game for sure.”\nDeion not in the playoffs but his stars will be playing\nThere are another 28 bowl games remaining that will have no implication on the national title. Maybe the best one is Dec. 28 when Heisman winner Travis Hunter and Colorado face BYU in the Alamo Bowl.\nThere's nothing particularly big on the line here, but there is a message being sent.\nColorado has two first-round draft picks on the roster in Hunter and the coach's son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Normally, they wouldn't find themselves anywhere near this game, for fear an injury could derail their pro prospects.\nBut they will play. Coach Deion Sanders has shouldered his share of criticism for being the face of a largely transactional, money-driven NIL era. But his ability to steer his best two players to find meaning in a game with no stakes is as old-school as it gets, and the exact opposite of the transfer portal mess.\n“It’s not just a bowl game where we’re going to go be merry and have a Merry Christmas and exchange gifts and do all of that,” the coach explained. “No, we want to go there and play Buff football.\"\n——\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "headline": "What is a biblically accurate angel? And do you need one to top your Christmas tree?",
      "subhead": "About 7 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe in angels, but what, exactly, is an angel",
      "body": "\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — It was during the pandemic when the Rev. Kira Austin-Young and her puppet-maker husband, Michael Schupbach, were going a little stir-crazy that they came up with the idea. Instead of a star or some stylized humanoid angel to top their Christmas tree, why not create a biblically accurate angel? \nThe result was a pink, blue and gold-feathered creature with six wings and dozens of eyes that went a little bit viral.\n“I think in, particularly, the times of the world that we’re in, where things seem kind of scary and weird, having a scary and weird angel sort of speaks to people,” she said. \nThere are a number of different kinds of angels that show up in the Bible, said Austin-Young, associate rector of the Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin in San Francisco. For the most part, we don't get a lot of description of them, but both Revelations at the end of the Bible and some of the books of the prophets in the Old Testament describe strange creatures around the throne of God. \n“Some of them have six wings with eyes covering the wings,\" she said. Others have multiple animal heads. “I think one of the delightful things about the Bible and the Scripture is just kind of how bizarre it can be and just how kind of out there it can be.”\nAbout 7 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe in angels, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted last year. Still, there's no agreement about what they look like or even exactly what they are. \nSocial media is full of various interpretations of “biblically accurate angels” imagined not just in tree toppers but also drawings, tattoos, even makeup tutorials. The many-eyed creatures reject traditional portrayals of angels in Western art, where they often look like humans with wings, usually white and often blonde or very fair.\nEsther Hamori, a professor of Hebrew Bible at Union Theological Seminary, makes a distinction between angels and other “supernatural species” in the Bible like seraphim and cherubim, but she said she loves the biblically accurate angel trend, even if it conflates them.\n“It shows that people are thinking about ways in which the Bible contains far stranger things than what’s often taught,\" the author of “God’s Monsters: Vengeful Spirits, Deadly Angels, Hybrid Creatures, and Divine Hitmen of the Bible\" wrote in an email. \n“The biblical heavens are filled with weird, frightening figures. In the Bible, God has an entourage of monsters.”\nOne of Austin-Young's favorite portrayals of the annunciation — a favorite theme of Christian art depicting the archangel Gabriel's appearance to Mary to announce that she is going to bear the son of God — is by Henry Ossawa Tanner. It conceives of Gabriel as a vaguely humanoid shaft of light.\n“It kind of makes you rethink, ‘What would that be like to be approached by an angel?’\" she said. \"If it’s somebody you don’t know, or if it’s a strange creature, or if it’s just this kind of manifestation of God’s message to you. ... That could be anything.”\n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "subhead": "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk’s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta’s Threads and its algorithms",
      "body": "\n\nBluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms. \nThe platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory — with a user base that has more than doubled since October — could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms. \nBut with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.\nThe skyrocketing user base — now surpassing 25 million — is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.\nBesides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil. \n“They got this spike in attention, they’ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,” said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media. “But they don’t have the cash flow, they don’t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.”\nTo manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as “starter packs” that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature. \nCompared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a “quite different” value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience. \n“The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,” Bluesky said on its blog in March. “Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.” \nBecause of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players. \n“People had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,” Wardle said. “But the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it’s in other people’s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.” \nLittle data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.\nLion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident — a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.\n“I noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper ‘Die Ziet,’” he said in an email to The Associated Press. “I have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk’s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.”\nCassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.\nThere are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.\nCopycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he’d initially detected — a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.\nBluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what’s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party “Labelers” that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context. \nThe company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.\nEven as its challenges aren’t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a “crossroads,” said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter’s civic integrity team.\n“Whether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,” Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.\nThat said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be. \nPolitical polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X. \n“Bluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,” Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're “trying to keep everybody happy” are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't — see Meta's platforms — the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

      "body": "\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers both showed out in a primetime matchup between two of the brightest stars in women's basketball.\nWatkins got the best of the rematch from last season's Elite Eight that UConn won, helping No. 7 USC to a 72-70 victory over the fourth-ranked Huskies on Saturday night in front of a sold out crowd of 15,684 fans.\nWatkins said it was probably the biggest crowd she’s played in front of so far.\n“I think it's a testament to when you give women's basketball a platform, we're going to perform,” said Watkins, who scored 25 points. \"I think tonight was an excellent game. ... It was beautiful to be a part of and I can imagine watching it, super exciting.”\nThe regular season win was big, but Watkins said it didn't erase the sting of last season's loss that ended the Trojans' season.\n“It was an Elite Eight game, clearly it weighs differently,” the sophomore sensation said. “Last year it meant a little bit more. Avenging that was important.”\nThe pair of All-Americans guarded each other for much of the game. On one possession in the third quarter, Watkins blocked Bueckers shot and then took the ball down to the other end and dribbled between her legs before scoring.\nHaving the two stars matched up was great theater.\n“Yeah definitely playing against great players you embrace the matchup and have fun in the moment,\" said Bueckers, who finished with 22 points. \"Both teams were trying to win. Matchups like these are why we play basketball.”\nBueckers later added that it was huge to have marquee matchups for the sport.\n“It’s very important for the game to continue to grow and have these types of matchups,” Bueckers said. “For people to not shy away from it and to embrace it and schedule more opponents like these.”\nGeno Auriemma has seen a lot of big games and stars over his 40 years at UConn. There was something special about Saturday night's game.\n“Happy that we can put two players like that on the floor that the whole country is familiar with and wants to see play well,” Auriemma said. “Both have their unique styles of playing.”\n“I was driving in today to the game and it brought back to me the very first game we played here in ‘86 or ’87, I don’t even know. ... I don’t think there were 100 people in the building. To drive up here and know there would be 16,000 people here plus the game on national television doesn’t seem like we’re talking about the same universe but this is what happened and where we are today. I'm proud to be a part of it.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "headline": "An architect designed custom clocks for Pennsylvania's Capitol a century ago. They're still ticking",
      "subhead": "Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence",
      "body": "\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. The seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately — and frequently capped by a dome.\nVisitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design.\nThe 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features.\nThey are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls.\nAnd every week, in a throwback to a time before wristwatches and cellphones, clock winders roam the halls — ensuring the century-plus-old timekeepers keep ticking.\nOn a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done — going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one.\nGill is a former art student who works for Johnson & Griffiths Studio, a Harrisburg firm that just received a five-year, $526,000 winding and maintenance contract renewal from the Capitol Preservation Committee.\nShe's also a lifelong clock lover who looks forward to the semiannual transitions between daylight saving time and Eastern Standard Time.\nWhy?\n“My dad was a clock collector growing up,” Gill said. “And every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad.”\nPennsylvania's Capitol was crafted by architect Joseph M. Huston, who won its design competition in 1901 with a vision for a temple of democracy — a palace of art that would be as fancy as what could then be found in Europe. \nAmong countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State.\n“The clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,” said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. “The mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.”\nEvery so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound.\nHuston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.\nWhile the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nBEIRUT (AP) — A prominent Lebanese politician held talks on Sunday with the insurgent who led the overthrow of Syria's President Bashar Assad, with both expressing hope for a new era in relations between their countries.\nDruze leader Walid Jumblatt is the most prominent Lebanese politician to visit Syria since the Assad family’s 54-year rule ended two weeks ago. Jumblatt was a longtime critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon and blamed Assad's father, former leader Hafez Assad, for the assassination of his own father.\nHe held talks with Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the Sunni Islamist rebels who swept into Damascus earlier this month and forced the younger Assad from power.\nNow wearing a suit and tie, al-Sharaa has been meeting with diplomats and others from around the region and beyond as Assad's fall reshapes alliances and gives many long-stifled Syrians hope after more than 13 years of civil war and international sanctions.\n“We salute the Syrian people for their great victories and we salute you for your battle that you waged to get rid of oppression and tyranny that lasted over 50 years,” said Jumblatt, a key figure in Lebanon’s Druze minority.\nHe expressed hope that Lebanese-Syrian relations “will return to normal.”\nJumblatt's father, Kamal, was killed in 1977 in an ambush near a Syrian roadblock during Syria's military intervention in Lebanon's civil war.\n“Syria was a source of concern and disturbance, and its interference in Lebanese affairs was negative,” al-Sharaa said, referring to the Assad government. “Syria will no longer be a case of negative interference in Lebanon,\" he added.\nAl-Sharaa also repeated longstanding allegations that Assad's government was behind the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was followed by other killings of prominent Lebanese critics of Assad.\nLast year, the United Nations closed an international tribunal investigating that assassination after it convicted three members of Lebanon's Hezbollah — an ally of Assad — in absentia. Hezbollah denied involvement in the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others.\n“We hope that all those who committed crimes against the Lebanese will be held accountable, and that fair trials will be held for those who committed crimes against the Syrian people,” Jumblatt said.\nIran's leader predicts trouble for new Syrian rulers\nSeparately, Iran's supreme leader asserted that young Syrians will resist the new government emerging after Assad's ouster, as he again accused the United States and Israel of sowing chaos in the country.\nIran provided crucial support to Assad throughout Syria's civil war, which erupted after he launched a violent crackdown on a popular uprising. Syria had long served as a key conduit for Iranian aid to Hezbollah.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on Sunday that the “young Syrian has nothing to lose\" and suffers from insecurity following Assad's fall.\n“What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,\" Khamenei said. He also accused the United States and Israel of plotting against Assad's government in order to seize resources.\nIran and its militant allies in the region have suffered major setbacks over the past year, with Israel battering Hamas in Gaza and landing heavy blows on Hezbollah before they agreed to a ceasefire in Lebanon last month.\nKhamenei denied that such groups were proxies of Iran, saying they fought because of their beliefs. “If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy force,” he said.\nPreserving evidence of crimes\nThe head of a U.N.-backed team investigating crimes committed during the civil war said they are working with the country’s new authorities in hopes of preserving evidence uncovered after Assad’s ouster.\n“We welcome the fact that we were invited to come and to engage with the authorities,” Robert Petit said Sunday, describing the meeting as “constructive.”\nAs journalists, researchers and the public stream into former detention centers and mass grave sites, many express fears that evidence is taken or destroyed.\nWafa Mustafa, a Syrian activist whose father, Ali, disappeared in 2013 in Damascus, said that \"no one gets to tell the families what happened without evidence, without search, without work, without effort.”\nReturning Syrians search for shattered homes\n\nSyria's civil war created millions of refugees, and thousands have begun returning. In a gray field of rubble outside Damascus, returnee Alaa Badawi worked with a shovel, looking for traces of his home.\nHis community, Qaboun, was an anti-government center and many of its buildings were flattened under Assad's administration.\n“Which is our house? Which is our alley? There is nothing visible,” Badawi said.\nHe and others decided to dig a little here and there to look for the house's distinctive tiles. “We finally discovered that this is our house,” he said. \"I do not know by then if I was happy to have located the house amid the rubble or upset because the house did not exist.”\nZiad Al-Hilli, one of the many people freed from prison as Assad fled to Russia, could not find his house, or his family.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a “massive” cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow's military. \nThe strikes came days after Russia launched sweeping attacks on Ukraine’s already battered energy grid, threatening to plunge thousands of homes into darkness as winter tightens its grip over the region, and as Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor nears the three-year mark.\nA fire broke out at the Stalnoy Kon oil terminal in Russia’s southern Oryol region, local Gov. Andrey Klychkov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app, adding Russian forces downed 20 drones targeting “fuel and energy infrastructure” in the province.\nRussian independent news outlet Astra shared video of what it said was an explosion at the site, showing a massive orange blaze lighting up the night sky. While the clip could not be independently verified, it was later shared by a Ukrainian security official who described it as footage from Oryol.\nThe official, Andriy Kovalenko of the Council of National Security and Defense, claimed the Oryol fuel depot supplies Russian forces fighting in Ukraine and southern Russia, including the Kursk province where Ukrainian troops have dug in following a lightning incursion in August. \nAccording to Klychkov, the Russian local governor, the fire was extinguished hours later and did not cause casualties or “significant” damage.\nUkraine's military previously claimed to have struck the Stalnoy Kon terminal with drones on Dec. 14, causing a “powerful” blaze. \nOther key war-related developments from Ukraine and Russia:\n— Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed retaliation after Ukrainian drones the day before struck residential buildings in the city of Kazan, in the Tatarstan region over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the front line. Speaking to Tatarstan's regional governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, Putin asserted that anyone attacking Russia has to reckon with Moscow inflicting “many times greater damage” in return, but did not elaborate. His remarks were carried by Russian state news agencies. \nMinnikhanov's press service on Saturday said that eight drones attacked Kazan. Local authorities said there were no casualties. \n— A 30-year-old man died on the spot Sunday in Ukraine's southern Kherson region after a Russian drone dropped explosives nearby, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Hours earlier, Prokudin said that two other civilians died as a result of Russian drone strikes on the province late on Saturday. A man in his late 40s suffered fatal injuries from a drone blast, and a woman was found dead under rubble after another drone slammed into her house.\n— In the Kharkiv region in the northeast, a Russian drone strike Sunday severely injured a 56-year-old man as he walked down a road in the city of Kupiansk, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. He said the man would need to have at least one limb amputated as a result, but gave no further detail.\n— In the Kyiv suburb of Brovary, debris from a Russian drone sparked a fire late on Saturday on the roof of a 25-story tower block, according to regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko. There were no immediate reports of any casualties.\n— According to Ukraine’s Air Force, Russia launched 103 Iranian-made Shahed drones at its neighbor overnight into Sunday. Ukrainian air defense shot down 52 of the drones while another 44 failed to reach their targets, the force said in a statement, in a likely reference to electronic jamming. \n— Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had intercepted 42 Ukrainian drones launched overnight at Russian territory. According to the ministry, 20 of those were over the Oryol region, where the local governor said a blaze tore through the oil terminal.\n— Separately, Russian forces have continued grinding forward in Ukraine’s northeast, in addition to eking out gains near the eastern town of Kurakhove. On Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that its troops had captured two northeastern settlements: Lozova in the Kharkiv region and Krasne in the Luhansk province. There was no immediate confirmation from Kyiv.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) — Lindsey Vonn lost a chance to improve her ranking when the second race of her World Cup skiing comeback at age 40 was canceled on Sunday due to strong winds and poor visibility.\nOn Saturday, Vonn placed 14th in a super-G on the Corviglia course in St. Moritz to mark her return to the circuit after nearly six years of retirement.\nVonn lost time at the start of the race but then was competitive with the top-five finishers the rest of the way down.\n“It took her 20 seconds to get back into it, and then she was fine,” said Chris Knight, Vonn’s personal coach.\nAnother super-G had been scheduled for Sunday.\n“She’d like to be in the top 15 later in the season,” Knight told The Associated Press when the race was canceled. “What we’re aiming for the next races is to accumulate points and get a better start number around the girls who are competitive.”\nSince Vonn hadn’t raced in so long, she had to use a new wild card for former champions that enabled her to start No. 31. But that’s still long after the top-ranked skiers start, leaving her with a bumpier and more challenging course.\n“If we can get around those other girls on the same track in the same conditions then you really know what’s going on,” Knight said.\nVonn now won’t race again until the next speed weekend in St. Anton, Austria on Jan. 11-12, which features a downhill and a super-G.\nAfter St. Anton, she plans to compete in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, and hopefully qualify for the world championships in Saalbach, Austria, in February.\nFor now, Vonn is heading home to Miami for the holidays. Then she will return to Europe for training in early January before resuming a near-full schedule of speed races.\n“We don’t have couple of races later on before finals on the schedule. But we’ll see,” Knight said. “I mean, it’s just moved so quickly.”\n___\nMore AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing\n\n",

The victims, including at least four children, collapsed during crowd surges as people grew desperate for food items while the country grapples with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\nThe dead included 22 people in southeastern Anambra state’s Okija town, where a philanthropist on Saturday organized a food distribution, local police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. Ten others died in the capital, Abuja, during a church-organized similar charity event.\nPolice said they were investigating the two incidents, only days after another stampede in which 35 children were killed. \nAfrica’s most populous country is seeing a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas to ease economic hardship caused by a cost-of-living crisis.\nWitnesses of the Abuja stampede told The Associated Press there was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before gift items were to be shared.\nSome of them, including older people, waited overnight to get food, said Loveth Inyang, who rescued one baby from the crush.\nThe stampedes prompted growing calls for authorities to enforce safety measures at such events. Nigerian police also mandated that organizers obtain prior permission.\n\n",

      "headline": "Winter is hitting Gaza and many Palestinians have little protection from the cold",
      "subhead": "Nearly two million displaced Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to protect themselves from the coming winter",
      "body": "\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 14-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain.\nThere is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, little wood for fires, and the tents and patched-together tarps families are living in have grown increasingly threadbare after months of heavy use, according to aid workers and residents.\nShadia Aiyada, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to the coastal area of Muwasi, has only one blanket and a hot water bottle to keep her eight children from shivering inside their fragile tent.\n“We get scared every time we learn from the weather forecast that rainy and windy days are coming up because our tents are lifted with the wind. We fear that strong windy weather would knock out our tents one day while we’re inside,” she said.\nWith nighttime temperatures that can drop into the 40s (the mid-to-high single digits Celsius), Aiyada fears that her kids will get sick without warm clothing.\nWhen they fled their home, her children only had their summer clothes, she said. They have been forced to borrow some from relatives and friends to keep warm.\nThe United Nations warns of people living in precarious makeshift shelters that might not survive the winter. At least 945,000 people need winterization supplies, which have become prohibitively expensive in Gaza, the U.N. said in an update Tuesday. The U.N. also fears infectious disease, which spiked last winter, will climb again amid rising malnutrition.\nThe U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, known as UNRWA, has been planning all year for winter in Gaza, but the aid it was able to get into the territory is “not even close to being enough for people,” said Louise Wateridge, an agency spokeswoman.\nUNRWA distributed 6,000 tents over the past four weeks in northern Gaza but was unable to get them to other parts of the Strip, including areas where there has been fighting. About 22,000 tents have been stuck in Jordan and 600,000 blankets and 33 truckloads of mattresses have been sitting in Egypt since the summer because the agency doesn’t have Israeli approval or a safe route to bring them into Gaza and because it had to prioritize desperately needed food aid, Wateridge said.\nMany of the mattresses and blankets have since been looted or destroyed by the weather and rodents, she said.\nThe International Rescue Committee is struggling to bring in children’s winter clothing because there “are a lot of approvals to get from relevant authorities,” said Dionne Wong, the organization’s deputy director of programs for the occupied Palestinian territories.\n“The ability for Palestinians to prepare for winter is essentially very limited,” Wong said.\nThe Israeli government agency responsible for coordinating aid shipments into Gaza said in a statement that Israel has worked for months with international organizations to prepare Gaza for the winter, including facilitating the shipment of heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets into the territory. \nMore than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it has said more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\nThe war was sparked by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel, where the militant group killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in Gaza.\nNegotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal, which would include a surge in aid into the territory. \nFor now, the winter clothing for sale in Gaza's markets is far too expensive for most people to afford, residents and aid workers said.\nReda Abu Zarada, 50, who was displaced from northern Gaza with her family, said the adults sleep with the children in their arms to keep them warm inside their tent.\n“Rats walk on us at night because we don’t have doors and tents are torn. The blankets don’t keep us warm. We feel frost coming out from the ground. We wake up freezing in the morning,” she said. “I’m scared of waking up one day to find one of the children frozen to death.”\nOn Thursday night, she fought through knee pain exacerbated by cold weather to fry zucchini over a fire made of paper and cardboard scraps outside their tent. She hoped the small meal would warm the children before bed.\nOmar Shabet, who is displaced from Gaza City and staying with his three children, feared that lighting a fire outside his tent would make his family a target for Israeli warplanes.\n“We go inside our tents after sunset and don’t go out because it is very cold and it gets colder by midnight,” he said. “My 7-year-old daughter almost cries at night because of how cold she is.”\n\n",

      "subhead": "Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 22 people, including five children",
      "body": "\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday killed at least 22 people, including five children, Palestinian medical officials said, while Gaza's small Christian community celebrated a pre-Christmas Mass.\nIsraeli authorities allowed a rare Gaza visit by the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, for the Mass while the ever-present buzz of Israeli drones was heard outside.\nOne of the latest Israeli strikes hit a school housing displaced people in Gaza City and killed at least eight, including three children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's military said it struck Hamas militants sheltering there.\nA strike on a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah late Saturday killed at least eight, including three women and two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. Another six people were killed in separate strikes on Sunday, according to local hospitals.\n“The children are still inside the house. We are looking for them. They were sleeping in the living room, five of them together,” said a relative of a victim, Noman Abu Samra, as people searched rubble in Deir al-Balah. A window full of children looked on.\nIsrael has carried out daily strikes in Gaza more than 14 months into the war with Hamas. It says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians, but the bombings frequently kill women and children.\nIsrael and Hamas recently appeared to draw closer to a ceasefire agreement that would include the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but several obstacles remain, and the indirect talks have repeatedly stalled.\nVatican envoy celebrates Mass with Gaza's Christians\nDozens of worshipers gathered in the Holy Family Church in Gaza City as Pizzaballa and other clergy celebrated Mass. A twinkling Christmas tree was decorated with golden ornaments.\n“I want to say, to tell you, that all the world, not only the Christian world, all the world is with you, So the war will finish and we will rebuild,” the cardinal said, urging Gazans to never be afraid.\nHis visit came as Pope Francis again criticized Israel's actions in Gaza. Francis said Saturday that his envoy had been unable to enter the territory because of Israeli bombing.\n“Yesterday children have been bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,” Francis said during his annual Christmas greetings at the Vatican. On Sunday, he called for a ceasefire.\nThe pope recently called for an investigation to determine if Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide, a conclusion later reached by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The International Court of Justice is investigating genocide allegations brought against Israel by South Africa.\nIsrael, which was founded as a refuge for Jews after the Nazi Holocaust, rejects such allegations. It says it is only at war with Hamas, which it accuses of genocidal violence in the attack that ignited the war.\nNow winter sets in\nIn that Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.\nIsrael’s subsequent bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\nThe offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in.\nIsrael has been carrying out a major operation in northern Gaza since early October, battling Hamas in the most isolated and heavily damaged part of the territory. Tens of thousands have fled as the military has ordered a complete evacuation and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter.\nThe Israeli military body overseeing civilian affairs in Gaza, known as COGAT, said on Friday it facilitated the evacuation of over 100 patients, caregivers and others from Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the north. They have struggled to function. COGAT said it also facilitated the delivery of 5,000 liters of fuel and food packages to the hospitals.\nKamal Adwan's director on Saturday asserted that Israel's military had ordered an evacuation and said shelling was occurring. Israel's military on Sunday said there was no evacuation order and it was unaware of any strikes there.\nPalestinian security force member killed in West Bank\nIn the volatile West Bank town of Jenin, militants shot and killed a member of the Palestinian security forces and wounded two others. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority launched a rare crackdown there this month.\nA statement from the security forces blamed the shooting on “outlaws,” without elaborating. The PA is internationally recognized but deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters.\nThe PA exercises limited authority in population centers in the West Bank. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast War, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state.\n___\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.\n___\nFollow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump, said Saturday that she's removing herself from consideration to be a Florida senator — ending speculation that she could replace Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been tapped to be the incoming administration's secretary of state. \n\"After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,\" Lara Trump posted on X. \nInstead, she promised a “big announcement to share in January.\" \nThe announcement comes weeks after Trump announced that she was stepping down as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, a move which raised questions about whether she might be vying for a Senate seat. \nIf Rubio is confirmed, his replacement — who would be chosen by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — would serve for two years until the next regularly scheduled election in 2026.\nElected as RNC co-chair in March, Trump was a key player in the GOP retaking the White House and control of the Senate, while maintaining a narrow House majority. What she does next could shape Republican politics, given her elevated political profile and her ties to the incoming president.\nThe idea of placing a Trump family member in the Senate had been backed by some Republicans, including Maye Musk, mother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who Trump has named co-head of a group tasked with reduce federal spending and regulations during his second term as president. \nRubio is expected to be swiftly confirmed to his new post by his Senate colleagues. DeSantis has said that Floridians are likely to know their next senator by the beginning of January. \n\n",

      "subhead": "Patrick Mahomes threw for 260 yards and a touchdown while running for a score on his ailing ankle, and the Kansas City Chiefs took a big step toward securing the No. 1 seed in the playoffs with a 27-19 victory over the Houston Texans",
      "body": "\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Patrick Mahomes knew he could run on the ankle he sprained last week. The bigger concern for the Chiefs quarterback was how he would stop, when all the weight and pressure and momentum would land squarely upon it.\nThe solution against Houston was simple: Mahomes didn't stop.\nThe two-time MVP kept chugging forward until he plowed into the end zone on a 15-yard scramble to cap the Chiefs' opening drive on Saturday. Mahomes proceeded to throw for 260 yards and another score, never once looking troubled by his ailing ankle, and led Kansas City to a 27-19 victory that put the Chiefs on the brink of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\nThe Chiefs (14-1) can clinch the postseason bye and home-field advantage if Buffalo loses to or ties New England on Sunday. If the Bills win, Kansas City can wrap it up by beating Pittsburgh on Christmas Day — its third game in an 11-day span.\n“I ask a lot from the guys around me. I feel like if I'm going to ask them to play through pain and nicks and bruises, I've got to do it as well,” Mahomes said. “That's something that I pride myself on is being out there with my guys.”\nXavier Worthy had seven catches for 65 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 55 yards and another score, and Marquise Brown had five catches for 45 yards for Kansas City in his first game this season after recovering from a shoulder injury.\nThe result was what Chiefs coach Andy Reid called his team's most comprehensive performance of the season.\nAs for Mahomes?\n“He spoils the dog out of us, he's so tough,” Reid said. “You get used to it. But most guys don't come back from that like he did.”\nC.J. Stroud threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Houston (9-6), and one of those TD throws came at a great expense. Tank Dell, who had six catches for 98 yards, sustained a devastating knee injury on the play and was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he would remain overnight.\n“All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team,” Ryans said. “It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game, playing really well for us.”\nStroud was visibly shaken by the injury and had to be consoled by teammates on the sideline.\n“I mean, all you can really do is pray,” he said.\nThere were questions early in the week about whether Mahomes, who has a history of ankle injuries, would play at all after he sustained a high ankle sprain late in last week's win over Cleveland. But he was off the injury report by Friday, and he was on the field and leading the Chiefs to a touchdown on their opening possession.\nHis scramble for a score was merely the start of a back-and-forth first half.\nThe Texans answered with a 33-yard field goal, then went on a 13-play, 82-yard drive that ended with Stroud's touchdown toss to Dalton Schutlz. But the Chiefs quickly regained the lead when Hunt barreled into the end zone, and they tacked on a field goal a few minutes later after Stroud's second interception to lead 17-10 at the break.\nDell was hurt on the Texans' opening drive of the third quarter. He was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch but collided with teammate Jared Wayne on his way to the ground. He immediately grabbed his left knee, and players from both teams surrounded him as he was loaded onto a cart and driven from the field.\nKa'imi Fairbairn promptly missed the extra point, and any momentum Houston might've had disappeared.\nKansas City marched the other way, relying heavily on Worthy, who touched the ball four times on the drive. The first-round pick finished it off with an 8-yard reception, giving him a season high for receiving yards and his eighth touchdown of the year.\nThe teams matched fourth-quarter field goals, and the Texans took over trailing 27-19 with just over five minutes to go. But the Chiefs forced a three-and-out, getting a sack from Josh Williams on a cornerback blitz, and ran out the clock from there.\n“This was a great test versus a really good playoff team,” Ryans said. “This was a playoff atmosphere here today. I thought our guys battled the right way. We just have to finish.”\nTaylor time\nPop star Taylor Swift was on hand for the Chiefs' regular-season finale. She has been spending more time with her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia, including making a surprise visit to Children's Mercy Hospital.\nInjuries\nHouston: OG Shaq Mason (left knee) left on the fourth play of the game. FS Jimmie Ward (foot) was hurt late in the first half.\nKansas City: LB Jack Cochrane fractured his ankle on special teams in the first quarter. RT Jawaan Taylor (knee) left in the third quarter and DT Chris Jones sustained a minor calf strain in the fourth.\nUp next\nThe Chiefs head to Pittsburgh and Houston welcomes Baltimore for the NFL's doubleheader on Christmas Day.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\n",

      "subhead": "Dominic DeLuca and Tony Rojas returned interceptions for touchdowns and Penn State toyed with mistake-prone SMU in a 38-10 victory in the opening round of the College Football Playoff",
      "body": "\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — In a time of incessant change, Penn State linebacker Dominic DeLuca is a throwback. \nThe former walk-on's team might be one too.\nDeLuca was guaranteed nothing when he arrived on campus nearly four years ago without the promise of a scholarship or much of anything else. He poured himself into his craft, carving out a niche as a special teams ace while working his way into the rotation on a defense that considers itself the best in the country.\nWith sixth-seeded Penn State off to a somewhat jittery start on Saturday against SMU in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the Nittany Lions needed a jolt. \nDeLuca provided two.\nThe first came on a pick-6 that gave Penn State an early lead. The second cut short an SMU drive when the Mustangs were threatening to get back in the game and set the stage for a 38-10 blowout that pushed the Nittany Lions (12-2) into the CFP quarterfinals against third-seeded Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Eve.\n“Dom is just a baller,” Penn State head coach James Franklin said after picking up his 100th victory with the school.\nOne whose journey may become increasingly rare when the NCAA trims roster sizes to 105 starting next season. \n“It breaks my heart a little bit that maybe Dom isn’t here if these rules were in place (when he arrived),” Franklin said.\nThe old ones still exist, for now. And Franklin used them to build a team that now has as many wins as any of the 130 editions that came before it.\n“We're a college football program that everybody should be proud of because those guys are doing it the right way at a time when it’s more challenging than it’s ever been,” he said.\nLinebacker Tony Rojas added a pick-6 of his own and Penn State shut down Kevin Jennings and the high-powered Mustangs (11-3), whose breakout season ended amid a flurry of mistakes and miscues and did little to shed the notion — particularly by those in Alabama — that the ACC runners-up didn't necessarily deserve a spot in the 12-team field in the first place.\n“I can't control the debate,” SMU coach Rhett Lashlee said. “I can't control what people are going to say. We got in. Today we got beat. We got beat soundly by a very good team.”\nTwo weeks after getting pushed around by Oregon in the Big Ten title game, Penn State responded by forcing three turnovers and collecting three sacks while holding the Mustangs to season lows in points and yards (253).\n“We wanted to put on a defensive performance like we did,” Penn State defensive tackle Dvon J-Thomas said. “Two pick-6s. Stopped the run. Stopped the pass game. We truly shut everything down.”\nJennings, whose electrifying play fueled SMU’s undefeated regular-season sprint through the ACC, finished 20 of 36 for 195 yards with a late touchdown and three picks. He began the day by missing a wide-open tight end Matthew Hibner at the goal line to end the Mustangs’ promising opening possession, and things only got worse from there, for Jennings and everyone else who made the nearly 1,400-mile trip from Dallas to central Pennsylvania.\nHis flip to Brashard Smith on SMU’s second drive sailed over the running back’s head and into the arms of an awaiting DeLuca, who raced 23 yards to the end zone to give Penn State the lead. Early in the second quarter, Jennings scrambled to his right and threw against his body into triple coverage. Rojas snagged it and weaved 59 yards to stake the Nittany Lions to a 14-0 lead they never came close to squandering.\nKaytron Allen ran for two scores and Nick Singleton added another for the Nittany Lions, a bruising 1-yard gash late in the first half that put Penn State up 28-0. Singleton punctuated it by jawing with Franklin on the sideline.\n“He screamed at me and used some words ... and said ‘I’m a violent man,’” Franklin said. “I kind of agreed with him.”\nDrew Allar completed 13 of 22 passes for 127 yards while playing every meaningful snap after backup Beau Pribula — who occasionally and effectively spelled Allar throughout the year — entered the transfer portal earlier this week.\nAnd unlike the ACC title game against Clemson — when the Mustangs roared all the way back from a 17-point second-half deficit to tie it before falling on the final snap — this time there would be no rally.\nThe last two quarters were mostly a chance for the crowd of over 106,000 that braved temperatures in the low-20s with a pretty steady breeze to soak in the kind of big game victory that hasn't happened quite as often as they would like during James Franklin's largely successful 11-year tenure.\nWith one test now passed, another big one awaits in the desert on the last day of 2024.\nTakeaways\nSMU: The Mustangs' historic first season in the ACC after coming over from the American Athletic ended with a disappointing thud. If Jennings hits Hibner for a score, maybe things change. They'll have all offseason to think about it.\nPenn State: Singleton and Allen believe they are the best running back combination in the country. They certainly looked it while teaming up to run for 160 yards and three scores.\nUp next\nSMU: will try to back up their audacious ACC debut next fall, when their conference slate includes games against Miami, Clemson and Louisville.\nPenn State: Will try to win a 13th game for the first time in the program's 131-year history when it heads to the Fiesta Bowl, a game in which the Nittany Lions are 7-0 all-time.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "body": "\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Texans wide receiver Tank Dell was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center and the team said he would remain overnight after sustaining a severe left knee injury while making a 30-yard touchdown catch in a 27-19 loss to the Chiefs on Saturday.\nDell was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch on a pass from C.J. Stroud before colliding with Houston teammate Jared Wayne on the way to the ground. Dell immediately grabbed at his knee and Wayne signaled for team trainers, who spent several minutes working on the wide receiver while teammates waited anxiously.\nDell was eventually placed on a stretcher and driven in a covered medical cart off the field, and then he was taken to the hospital.\n“We'll get an update (Monday) on him,” Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. “All of our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team. It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game.”\nDell had six catches for 98 yards and the touchdown when he was hurt with 11:40 left in the third quarter.\nStroud, who is one of Dell's closest friends, was visibly shaken. He had tears in his eyes as he watched Dell get loaded onto the cart, and Stroud was still getting consoled by teammates when he walked back to the Houston sideline.\n“It's not easy to just let it go, especially (because) that's my best friend. It's not easy to move on and keep playing,” Stroud said. “I tried to do the best I could. My teammates helped me up. I appreciate the guys talking to me as I was going through it.”\nThe touchdown should have tied the game, but Ka'imi Fairbairn missed the ensuing extra point. The Chiefs took advantage of the momentum swing and marched 80 yards for a touchdown and a 24-16 lead, and they put away the game from there.\n“You see your brother go down and get hurt that way, it’s hard to bounce back,” Ryans said. “You see him and how distraught he was, it’s hard to bounce back. It’s hard to rebound, because we care about each other. It’s not just about getting back to football. We truly care about each other, and in that moment, the most important thing was making sure that Tank was OK.”\nIt's the second straight year Dell has sustained what is certain to be a season-ending injury. He fractured his fibula in Week 13 against the Broncos last season, just as the rookie was breaking out, and had surgery on it the following day.\nThen in April, the 25-year-old wide receiver was an innocent bystander at a private event in Sanford, Florida, when he sustained a minor gunshot wound. Dell spent a brief amount of time in the hospital but was able to return to Houston soon afterward.\n“He loves this game so much. I don’t think that’s much of a question,” Texans receiver Xavier Hutchinson said. “He’s going to fight back. He’s going to come back even stronger, like he did this year. It’s only a matter of time.”\nDell was the second Texans player carted off Saturday. Free safety Jimmie Ward hurt his foot late in the first half.\nEarlier in the game, the Texans' banged-up offensive line lost starting guard Shaq Mason to a knee injury on the fourth play, and backup lineman Blake Fisher had to be helped off with an undisclosed injury later in the first half. Their injuries came after Juice Scruggs, another starter on the offensive line, was declared inactive because of a foot injury.\nKansas City also sustained some significant injuries on a chilly, wind-swept Saturday.\nThe biggest was to defensive tackle Chris Jones, who was unable to finish after straining a calf. Chiefs coach Andy Reid would not say whether he thought the two-time All-Pro would be able to play against Pittsburgh on Christmas Day.\nChiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor did not return after straining his knee, while backup linebacker Jack Cochrane is likely done for the season after he fractured his ankle while blocking on a special teams early in the game.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A rocket fired from Yemen hit an area of Tel Aviv overnight, leaving 16 people injured by shattered glass, the Israeli military said Saturday, days after Israeli airstrikes hit Houthi rebels who have been launching missiles in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. \nAnother 14 people had minor injuries as they rushed to shelters when air raid sirens sounded before dawn, the military said.\nThe Houthis in a statement on Telegram said they had aimed a hypersonic ballistic missile at a military target that they did not identify. Israel's military said it was investigating, adding that “we emphasize that aerial defense is not hermetic.”\n“A flash of light, a blow and we fell to the ground. Big mess, broken glasses all over the place,” said Bar Katz, a resident of a damaged building.\nThe Houthis’ media office later reported airstrikes on Yemen’s Houthi-held capital, Sanaa. U.S. forces conducted airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command facility operated by the Houthis, the U.S. Central Command said in a statement on X.\nThe attack on Tel Aviv came after Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida killed at least nine people Thursday. The strikes came hours after a missile from Yemen hit a school building in central Israel. The Houthis also claimed a drone strike targeting an unspecified military target in central Israel that day.\nIsrael's military says the Iran-backed Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and drones during the 14-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis have also attacked shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and say they won’t stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.\nThe Israeli strikes Thursday caused “considerable damage” to the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The Hodeida port has been key for food shipments into Yemen in its decade-long civil war.\nIsraeli strikes in Gaza kill a dozen children\nMourners in Gaza held funerals for 19 Palestinians — 12 of them children — killed in Israeli strikes on Friday and overnight.\nOne strike hit a residential building in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven, including five children and one woman, and injuring 16 others, health officials said.\nIn Gaza City, a strike on a house killed 12, including seven children and two women, according to Al-Ahli Hospital where the bodies were taken. One man cradled a tiny shroud-wrapped body as mourners gathered.\nLater Saturday, al-Awda Hospital said an airstrike hit a house in Nuseirat and killed four people including two children, with 14 other people wounded. Israel's military said it was checking the report.\nAnd Saturday night, large explosions could be seen on the Gaza skyline. Five bodies arrived soon afterward at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\nMore than 45,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, when a Hamas attack in Israel killed about 1,200 people and triggered the war. Gaza's Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said more than half of fatalities are women and children.\nIsrael faces heavy international criticism over the unprecedented levels of civilian deaths in Gaza. It says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas.\nNorthern Gaza hospital says it is told to evacuate\nThe director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya in largely isolated northern Gaza said in an online message late Saturday that Israel's military had told the facility to evacuate. \nDr. Husam Abu Safiyeh asserted that the intensive care unit, maternity ward and other departments were being targeted, and said evacuating would mean transferring 66 patients.\nIsrael's military in response to questions said it was “not aware of any strikes in the area of the hospital at this time.” There was no immediate response to questions about the reported evacuation order.\nGaza's Health Ministry earlier reported continuous gunfire and Israeli shelling near the hospital, and it issued an urgent appeal for medical and food supplies to be delivered to the facility as Israel's military pressed its latest offensive.\nSafiyeh has said the facility faced “severe shortages” including of food and asserted that requests for essential medical supplies and ways to maintain oxygen, water and electricity systems \"have largely gone unmet.”\nAid groups have said Israeli military operations and armed gangs have hindered their ability to distribute aid.\nThe Israeli military organization dealing with humanitarian affairs for Gaza said Saturday it had led an operation delivering thousands of food packages, flour and water to the Beit Hanoun area in the north..\nA killing in Syria\nIran on Saturday said unknown gunmen killed a local staffer of the Iranian Embassy in Syria in Damascus last Sunday, the official IRNA news agency said.\nIts report quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei as saying “terrorists” opened fire on Davood Bitaraf’s car. It did not say what he did with the embassy. The shooting happened the day that opposition fighters took Damascus and ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad.\nBaghaei said Iran considers Syria’s interim government responsible for finding and prosecuting those behind the killing. Iran had been a key Assad ally.\n___\nShurafa reported from Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip.

      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — A NASA spacecraft aims to fly closer to the sun than any object sent before. \nThe Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun. Since then, it has flown straight through the sun's corona: the outer atmosphere visible during a total solar eclipse. \nThe next milestone: closest approach to the sun. Plans call for Parker on Tuesday to hurtle through the sizzling solar atmosphere and pass within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles (6 million kilometers) of the sun's surface. \nAt that moment, if the sun and Earth were at opposite ends of a football field, Parker \"would be on the 4-yard line,” said NASA's Joe Westlake.\nMission managers won't know how Parker fared until days after the flyby since the spacecraft will be out of communication range. \nParker planned to get more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, hitting 430,000 mph (690,000 kph) at closest approach. It's the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).\nIt'll continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Scientists hope to better understand why the corona is hundreds of times hotter than the sun’s surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun. \nThe sun's warming rays make life possible on Earth. But severe solar storms can temporarily scramble radio communications and disrupt power. \nThe sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, triggering colorful auroras in unexpected places. \n“It both is our closest, friendliest neighbor,” Westlake said, “but also at times is a little angry.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

      "body": "\n\nBEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is “playing with fire.”\nU.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory and says must come under its control. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called “dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”\nU.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack.\nThe $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts.\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's “commitment to our defense.”\nIn October, the U.S. approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, also drawing China’s criticism while Beijing has responded with war drills around Taiwan. \nTaiwan earlier this month demanded that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said undermed peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. \nTrump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nKILLEEN, Texas (AP) — A pickup truck driver fleeing police careened through the doors of a JCPenney store in Texas and continued through a busy mall, injuring five people before he was fatally shot by officers, authorities said.\nThe truck crashed into the department store in Killeen, about 68 miles (109 kilometers) north of the state capital Austin, around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and continued into the building, striking people as it went, Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety said in an evening news briefing. \nEmergency medical services transported four victims from the mall to area hospitals and another traveled to a hospital separately. They ranged in age from 6 to 75 years old and their conditions were not immediately known, he said. \nThe chase began around 5 p.m. on Interstate 14 in Belton, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from Killeen, after authorities received calls about an erratic driver in a black pickup, Ofelia Miramontez of the Killeen Police Department said.\nThe driver then pulled off the road and drove into the parking lot of the mall.\n“The suspect drove through the doors and continued to drive through the JCPenney store, striking multiple people,” Washko said. “The trooper and the Killeen police officer continued on foot after this vehicle, which was driving through the store, actively running people over. He traveled several hundred yards.”\nOfficers from the state public safety department, Killeen and three other law enforcement agencies “engaged in gunfire to eliminate this threat,” Washko said.\nOne of the officers who traded gunfire with the suspect was working as a security guard at the mall and others were off duty, he said.\nWashko did not have information about the suspect's identity at the time of the briefing.\nWitnesses interviewed by local news outlets outside the mall said they heard multiple gunshots and saw people fleeing through the mall.\n\n",

That was cool, he said, but this was better.\n“Imagine him under water feeding the fish? It’s even cooler,” Guilherme told The Associated Press.\nThis version of Santa Claus is Felippe Luna, 39, a senior animal handler at AquaRio. What began as a joke among staff has become an annual tradition.\nDressed as Santa, Luna dives into the aquarium’s 924,602-gallon tank to feed marine animals, including sharks. “For the kids, seeing Santa Claus under water is already incredible. And Santa feeding a shark by hand? That’s unforgettable,” Luna said.\nThe Santa Claus dive runs daily at AquaRio through Dec. 25 at 1:30 p.m.\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n\n",

When time expired, Mazzulla appeared to have some angry words for referee Justin Van Duyne.\nMazzulla later said he was just trying to spread holiday cheer to the referee crew.\n“I just hadn’t seen them in a while, so just a merry Christmas, happy holidays, wasn’t sure I was going to see them before the holiday,” Mazzulla explained in his postgame news conference. “I just can’t let a moment go by where you wish someone just the best to them and theirs and their families.”\nVideo of the exchange does not seem to indicate he was offering glad tidings.\nCrew chief Tony Brothers said after the game that Brown got his technical for questioning the integrity of an official. Tatum got his technical for “an overt action towards an official,” Brothers said.\nBrown said Van Duyne called him for a technical for no reason and that Mazzulla “didn't say anything” that would have merited a technical.\n“You can't threaten guys with a technical foul,” Brown said.\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\n",

      "subhead": "A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct",
      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct. \nAny movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows.\nThe 93-page report released Saturday by the Democratic majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee found additional travel taken in 2021 by Thomas but not reported on his annual financial disclosure form: a private jet flight to New York's Adirondacks in July and jet and yacht trip to New York City sponsored by billionaire Harlan Crow in October, one of more than two dozen times detailed in the report that Thomas took luxury travel and gifts from wealthy benefactors.\nThe court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, but it leaves compliance to each of the nine justices. \n“The highest court in the land can’t have the lowest ethical standards,” the committee chairman, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, said in a statement. He has long called for an enforceable code of ethics. \nRepublicans protested the subpoenas authorized for Crow and others as part of the investigation. No Republicans signed on to the final report, and no formal report from them was expected. \nA spokesman for Crow said he voluntarily agreed to provide information for the investigation, which did not pinpoint any specific instances of undue influence. Crow said in a statement that Thomas and his wife Ginni had been unfairly maligned. “They are good and honorable people and no one should be treated this way,” he said. \nAttorney Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas who has been tapped for the incoming Trump administration, said the report was aimed at conservatives whose rulings Democrats disagreed with. \n“This entire investigation was never about ‘ethics’ but about trying to undermine the Supreme Court,\" Paoletta said in a statement posted on X. \nThe court did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThomas has said he was not required to disclose the trips that he and his wife took with Crow because the big donor is a close friend of the family and disclosure of that type of travel was not previously required. The new ethics code does explicitly require it, and Thomas has since gone back and reported some travel. \nThe report traces back to Justice Antonin Scalia, saying he “established the practice” of accepting undisclosed gifts and hundreds of trips over his decades on the bench. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and retired Justice Stephen Breyer also took subsided trips but disclosed them on their annual forms, it said.\nThe investigation found that Thomas has accepted gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors worth more than $4.75 million by some estimates since his 1991 confirmation and failed to disclose much of it. “The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,” according to the report.\nIt also detailed a 2008 luxury trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito. He has said he was exempted from disclosing the trip under previous ethical rules. \nAlito also declined calls to withdraw from cases involving Donald Trump or the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after flags associated with the riot were seen flying at two of Alito's homes. Alito has said the flags were raised by this wife. \nThomas has ignored calls to step aside from cases involving Trump, too. Ginni Thomas supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden. \nThe report also pointed to scrutiny of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. Justices have also heard cases involving their book publishers, or involving companies in which justices owned stock. \nBiden has been the most prominent Democrat calling for a binding code of conduct. Justice Elena Kaganhas publicly backed adopting an enforcement mechanism, though some ethics experts have said it could be legally tricky. \nJustice Neil Gorsuch recently cited the code when he recused himself from an environmental case. He had been facing calls to step aside because the outcome could stand to benefit a Colorado billionaire whom Gorsuch represented before becoming a judge. \nThe report also calls for changes in the Judicial Conference, the federal courts’ oversight body led by Chief Justice John Roberts, and further investigation by Congress.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Blake Lively has accused her “It Ends With Us” director and co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the movie and a subsequent effort to “destroy” her reputation in a legal complaint",
      "body": "\n\nBlake Lively has accused her “It Ends With Us” director and co-star Justin Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of the movie and a subsequent effort to “destroy” her reputation in a legal complaint.\nThe complaint obtained by The Associated Press, which The New York Times reported was filed Friday with the California Civil Rights Department, precedes a lawsuit. It names Baldoni, the studio behind the romantic drama “It Ends With Us” and Baldoni's publicists among the defendants.\nIn the complaint, Lively accuses Baldoni and the studio of embarking on a “multi-tiered plan” to damage her reputation following a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed “repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior” by Baldoni and a producer on the movie. \nThe plan, the complaint said, included a proposal to plant theories on online message boards, engineer a social media campaign and place news stories critical of Lively. \nBaldoni enlisted publicists and crisis managers in a “sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" meant to “bury” and “destroy” Lively if she went public with her on-set concerns, the complaint alleges. \n“To safeguard against the risk of Ms. Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr. Baldoni, the BaldoniWayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms. Lively’s credibility,” the complaint states. “They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr. Baldoni’s credibility and suppress any negative content about him.”\nThe complaint also says Baldoni “abruptly pivoted away from” the movie's marketing plan and “used domestic violence ‘survivor content’ to protect his public image.”\nBryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, called the claims “completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.”\nHe pushed back against Lively's allegations of a coordinated campaign, saying the studio “proactively” hired a crisis manager “due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production.\"\nFreedman also said Lively threatened to not appear on set and not promote the film “if her demands were not met.” \nThose demands were not specified in the statement, but Lively's complaint lists 30 demands that she said Baldoni and others agreed to after their tense sit-down over her hostile work environment concerns.\nAmong them: “no more showing of nude videos or images of women” to Lively and others on set and no more discussions about pornography, sexual experiences or genitalia.\nShe also said Baldoni should not ask her trainer about her weight without her consent, should not press her about her religious beliefs and should make “no further mention of her dead father.”\nAn intimacy coordinator was also required to be on set whenever Lively shared a scene with Baldoni and he was barred from entering her trailer or the make-up trailer while she was undressed.\nThe demands also stipulated that there would be “no more improvising of kissing” scenes or adding of sex scenes to the film outside of the ones in the script Lively approved when she signed on.\n“I hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,” Lively said in a statement to the Times. A representative for Lively referred the AP to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.\n“It Ends With Us,” an adaptation of Colleen Hoover's bestselling 2016 novel, was released in August, exceeding box office expectations with a $50 million debut. But the movie's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between the lead pair. Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took centerstage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for “Deadpool & Wolverine” at the same time.\nBaldoni — who starred in the telenovela send-up “Jane the Virgin,” directed “Five Feet Apart” and wrote “Man Enough,” a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity — did respond to concerns that the film romanticized domestic violence, telling the AP at the time that critics were “absolutely entitled to that opinion.”\n“If anybody has had that real-life experience, I can imagine how hard it would be to imagine their experience being in a romance novel,” he said. “To them, I would just offer that we were very intentional in the making of this movie.”\n___\nPhilip Marcelo in New York contributed to this report. \n\n",

      "subhead": "The top uniformed police officer in the New York Police Department has resigned amid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate",
      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — The highest-ranking uniformed officer in the New York Police Department has resigned amid allegations he demanded sex from a subordinate in exchange for opportunities to earn extra pay.\nPolice Commissioner Jessica Tisch accepted Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey ’s resignation Friday night, effective immediately, according to a department statement Saturday.\nChief of Patrol John Chell will take over as interim chief of department, and Philip Rivera will assume Chell’s duties as the head of the patrol division, the NYPD said.\nLate Saturday, Tisch replaced the head of the internal affairs bureau, which investigates alleged police misconduct, saying in a statement that the unit “must always be dedicated to preserving integrity and rooting out corruption in all its forms.” She appointed Edward Thompson as interim chief after Miguel Iglesias was relieved of his command.\nThe NYPD declined to comment on the allegations against Maddrey other than to say it “takes all allegations of sexual misconduct seriously and will thoroughly investigate this matter.”\nA lawyer for his accuser, Lt. Quathisha Epps, said the move was overdue.\n“This should have been done a long time ago,” lawyer Eric Sanders said by phone Saturday. “This has been years in the making, this kind of behavior. This is not a shock for anyone who understands how things work in this department.”\nEpps filed a complaint Saturday against the city with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, claiming that Maddrey engaged in “quid pro quo sexual harassment” by coercing her to “perform unwanted sexual favors in exchange for overtime opportunities in the workplace.”\nEpps, who holds an administrative post in Maddrey’s office, said that when she finally pushed back at Maddrey's demands, he retaliated by claiming she was abusing overtime, prompting the department to launch a review.\nSanders said his client was then suspended without pay despite putting in her retirement notice earlier this week. \nEpps was the department’s top earner in fiscal year 2024, earning more than $400,000, according to local media reports — more than half of it in overtime pay. \n“Ms. Epps has endured profound harm at the hands of individuals who exploited their positions of power for personal gain,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"The retaliation she faced for standing up to this abuse underscores the need for immediate reforms to address systemic failures within the NYPD.” \nSpokespersons for the department declined to comment on the complaint, but Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office said it is investigating. \n“These are extremely serious and disturbing claims that allegedly occurred at N.Y.P.D. headquarters in Manhattan,\" the office said in a statement. \nA spokesperson for Mayor Eric Adams said Tisch, whom he tapped last month to steady a department roiled by investigations, is conducting her own departmentwide review “to ensure no high ranking officers are using their power inappropriately.\"\n“We are deeply disturbed by these allegations,\" Kayla Mamelak Altus said in a statement, while declining to comment further for now.\nMaddrey's attorney, Lambros Lambrou, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the various allegations. However, in a statement to the New York Post, he dismissed Epps' claims as “completely meritless.\" \n“What a convenient time to accuse somebody of misconduct after she’s caught stealing time,” Lambrou told the paper. “She’s obviously drowning and in the deep end of the pool without a lifesaver. She wants to take down as many people as she can.\"\nSanders responded that any overtime his client worked was at the request of Maddrey and approved by him and other department officials.\nMeanwhile, Maddrey has been the subject of other misconduct allegations, including one from a police captain who says she rebuffed his unwanted advances for years.\nJohn Scola, a lawyer for Gabrielle Walls, said in a statement that Maddrey’s departure “vindicates” the police captain, who this week amended her sexual harassment lawsuit against another top officer to include Maddrey. \nWalls said in the filing that she dreaded interacting with Maddrey because he frequently tried to kiss her, and at times took to hiding with the door locked and lights turned off.\n“We hope this high-profile resignation marks the beginning of a cultural shift to eliminate the pervasive environment of harassment and retaliation within the NYPD,” Scola said. \nA former officer has also claimed Maddrey coerced her into a yearslong affair while he was her supervisor, though that case was dismissed by a state judge last month, the New York Post and others reported.\nEarlier this year, an administrative trial judge in the department recommended dropping a disciplinary case against Maddrey regarding a November 2021 incident in which he ordered officers to void the arrest of a retired officer who previously worked for him.\nMaddrey joined the police force in 1991 at the age of 20 and rose through the ranks to become chief of patrol in 2021, before being promoted to chief of department last December, according to his department biography.\nThe chief of department is charged with overseeing the department’s “crime-fighting strategies, quality of life initiatives, and operational plans,” according Tisch’s Saturday announcement. The chief of patrol manages the department’s largest bureau, which consists of 15,000 uniformed patrol officers and 3,000 civilians.\n“The NYPD works tirelessly to protect New Yorkers, and these roles are critical to keeping our communities safe,” Tisch said in her statement. “The interim Chiefs of Department and Patrol will continue to lead the efforts to reduce crime and disorder and build public trust.”\n___\nAssociated Press reporter Michael R.

      "subhead": "For Christians around the world, Christmas is the joyful celebration of the birth of Jesus",
      "body": "\n\nFor Christians around the world, Christmas is the joyful celebration of the birth of Jesus. To affirm their beliefs — that God is present and hasn’t abandoned them — the faith community at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is embracing its holiday traditions just days after a deadly shooting there.\n“When people say, ‘Where is your God?’ He is more evident now than he’s ever been to us,” the Rev. Sarah Karlen told The Associated Press. “I’m sure the phrase ‘Prince of Peace’ and ‘God with us’ is going to be leaned into a little more this year.”\nKarlen is a pastor at City Church, which in the late 1970s founded the school where she’s also the theater teacher. On Saturday, in the same space decorated with festive trees where students had performed their Christmas concert just the previous week, the church held the funeral of a 14-year-old student, Rubi Patricia Vergara. She was killed Monday when another student opened fire, also killing a teacher and wounding several others at the school on the same campus.\n“When we say that God is with us, especially here at Christmas time — when we say, you know, Emmanuel ‘God with us,’ that he came to Earth to be with us — I know beyond a shadow of a doubt each and every one of us here at City Church would say that in a very new way,” Karlen added.\nDecked in holiday light displays and a Nativity scene, the evangelical, nondenominational church with over 1,200 members also hosted a vigil service Tuesday.\nThen, drawing from Scripture and particularly the Book of Job, pastors addressed the challenge of reconciling faith in a loving God with his allowing great suffering to occur.\nKarlen also challenged some of the taunts on the school’s social media that questioned its religious beliefs. To the assembly’s applause, she repeatedly affirmed God’s presence in the midst of the grieving and the weariness.\n“None of us on our staff are saying that we understand why or how something happened. But we do understand that God sees us, sees things very differently than we do,” Karlen said later.\nPolice are continuing to investigate why Natalie “Samantha” Rupnow, 15, attacked the school before fatally shooting herself. While dozens of school shootings have happened across the U.S. in recent years, the vast majority are carried out by teenage boys and young men.\nBarbara Wiers said faith is helping teachers, students and families make peace with the possibility they will never have complete answers.\n“There may never be sense made out of this senseless tragedy. But. God, right? God understands, and God was there, and God is still here,” said Wiers, the school’s director for elementary education and communications. “Ultimately, it’s not about man’s judgment, although there’s going to be all of that — because of the legal system and how that plays out. But God’s just judgment will reign. And we trust him for that.”\nThe school remains closed as staff work to repair the physical damage so that it won’t retraumatize teachers and students immediately upon their return, Wiers said. Safety and wellness protocols are also being reviewed.\nBut on Christmas Eve, City Church plans to hold caroling and candlelight services, hoping that the community will draw comfort from the familiar traditions.\n“We know this is a long road for all of us, but the start is to be in the presence of God with one another, and to hug one another, and to sing together, to pray together,” Karlen said.\nOther churches affiliated with the school, as well as the broader community in Madison, quickly came together to help, from alumni starting food drives to evangelical ministries sending chaplains to pastors sitting up with those hospitalized.\n“Healing will come slowly, but they will not be left alone,” said the Rev. Kerri Parker, executive director of the Wisconsin Council of Churches, whose member organizations include about 2,000 churches and 1 million Christians.\nAt Saturday's funeral, Vergara's uncle, Andy Remus, said the family has “no bitterness or unforgiveness\" toward the Rupnows. He urged the school to continue its mission to teach Christian values and praised the community's response.\n“For every person that says, ‘Where is your God now?’ There are 10,000 good, caring people in Madison,” Remus said, his voice breaking. \nAbundant Life Christian School is part of Impact Christian Schools, a network of private educational institutions that welcome families regardless of their creed, said Impact’s executive director Chuck Moore. \nMoore said he hoped the shooting’s occurrence so close to the holidays wouldn’t forever tie Christmas with tragedy for the community.\n“Even in the midst of awful, it’s still a time we can rejoice,” Moore said. “We can focus our celebration on who Christ is.”\nAlready teachers at the school have talked about Jesus and faith in “every classroom, every subject, all day long, because God isn’t siloed to Sunday,” Wiers said. And that focus will continue when the school reopens sometime in January. \n“We’re changed. Our family is changed. But God hasn’t changed. He didn’t move. He hasn’t been altered at all,” Wiers said. “And the message hasn’t changed. God is good. God is good all the time. He is faithful and he is true. And while we are brokenhearted, he’s going to walk us through this.”\nIn the last prayer before leaving the church for the cemetery on Saturday, City Church's lead pastor also urged the community to let God's comfort and promise of eternal life break through the crushing pain.\n“There is a heaven, don’t let your heart be troubled,\" the Rev. Tom Flaherty said. \"This is not all there is, folks.” \n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "headline": "France's Mayotte struggles to recover as cyclone overwhelms hospitals",
      "subhead": "A week after Cyclone Chido ravaged Mayotte, France’s poorest territory, the island remains in crisis",
      "body": "\n\nMAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — One week after its worst cyclone in nearly a century, and a day after a testy presidential visit, France’s impoverished Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte is still grappling with counting the dead, restoring essential services and aiding a beleaguered population. \nCyclone Chido wreaked devastation across the archipelago. Already stretched thin, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients suffering not only from cyclone-related injuries but also from dehydration, malnutrition and disease.\nAt Mayotte’s main hospital in the capital, Mamoudzou, doctors faced a cascade of crises.\n“We lost 40% of patient rooms, about 50 to 60 beds,” said Dr. Roger Serhal, chief of the obstetrics and gynecology department. “There are so many patients coming to the hospital, and we don’t have space to admit them.”\nAs Chido battered the archipelago last weekend with 220 kph (136 mph) winds, Serhal and his team delivered three babies, including by cesarean section.\nThe hospital’s structural damage has forced staff to triage patients, prioritizing the most severe cases. Though the official death toll remains 35, according to the French Interior Ministry on Saturday, the number of seriously injured has risen to 78, with 2,432 others sustaining minor injuries. Health Minister Geneviève Darrieussecq has warned that any estimates are likely major undercounts “compared to the scale of the disaster.”\nEmergency aid was being delivered by air and sea. Since the cyclone, 31 tons of food and 108 tons of water have arrived, with an additional 1.6 million liters of water expected Monday aboard a container ship, according to the Interior Ministry.\nThe hospital is operating at 50% capacity, while 109 patients have been evacuated to mainland France for urgent care. Three advanced medical posts have been established on Grande-Terre, Mayotte’s main island, to address the surge in need.\nThe storm has devastated entire neighborhoods. Many people ignored warnings, thinking the storm wouldn’t be so extreme. Even worse, many migrants avoided shelters out of fear of deportation, authorities said, adding there could be hundreds or possibly thousands of fatalities.\nDoctors fear that the lack of clean water and electricity — compounded by overcrowded living conditions — is setting the stage for a health crisis. “Patients are coming because their illnesses are untreated, there’s no water, and no electricity. We’re concerned about epidemics, like the cholera outbreak we stopped just months ago,” said Dr. Vincent Gilles, the hospital’s emergency medical director.\nThe hospital staff continues to work tirelessly, but resources are running dangerously low. “If we have rain it will be catastrophic,” Serhal said. \nAmong the patients struggling to recover is Saindou Mohamadi, 54, who fractured his arm and sprained his ankle during the storm that left his home completely destroyed. Speaking from his hospital bed, Mohamadi expressed despair for his family. “My mother is sick, I’m sick, and my child is sick,” he said. “They need to eat, but I’m the one who takes care of the food, and now we have nothing.” With six children to support, Mohamadi is among countless residents left homeless and destitute.\n“I’m not alone,” he said. “There are many of us who have lost everything — our houses, our food. I want the government to care about us, to give us food and a place to sleep.”\nMayotte, a densely populated archipelago of over 320,000 people, is also home to an estimated 100,000 migrants, many living in precarious conditions. \nThe poorest overseas region of France and, by extension, the European Union has long struggled with systemic neglect and underinvestment. Around 75% of its population lives in poverty, and the archipelago’s infrastructure was ill-equipped to withstand a disaster of this magnitude. Chido’s destruction has compounded these challenges, leaving many residents with little faith in the government’s ability to provide timely and adequate relief.\nEfforts to deliver emergency aid, including airlifts of water and food, are underway, but the scale of the need is staggering. Mayotte’s airport remains closed to civilian flights due to damage, further complicating logistics.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, during his visit on Friday, acknowledged the gravity of the situation and pledged to rebuild but faced criticism from residents frustrated by the slow pace of aid.\nCalling the archipelago “totally devastated,” Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau painted a bleak picture — with some 70% of the population gravely affected by the catastrophe, and many left homeless and vulnerable. For now, the island’s residents and its overstretched medical staff are left to confront the daunting aftermath of Chido, one day at a time.\n___\nAdamson reported from Paris. \n\n",

      "subhead": "After days of threats and demands, Donald Trump had little to show for it once lawmakers passed a budget deal",
      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — After days of threats and demands, Donald Trump had little to show for it once lawmakers passed a budget deal in the early hours of Saturday, narrowly averting a pre-Christmas government shutdown.\nThe president-elect successfully pushed House Republicans to jettison some spending, but he failed to achieve his central goal of raising the debt limit. It demonstrated that despite his decisive election victory and frequent promises of retribution, many members of his party are still willing to openly defy him.\nTrump’s decision to inject himself into the budget debate a month before his inauguration also showed that he remains more adept at blowing up deals than making them, and it foreshadowed that his second term will likely be marked by the same infighting, chaos and brinksmanship that characterized his first.\n“Stay tuned. Buckle up. Strap in,” said Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., a senior appropriator.\nA glance at Trump’s agenda shows a cascade of opportunities for similar showdowns in the years to come. He wants to extend tax cuts that he signed into law seven years ago, slash the size of government, increase tariffs on imports and crack down on illegal immigrants. Many of those efforts will need congressional buy-in.\nFor many of Trump’s supporters, disruption could be its own goal. Thirty-seven percent of those who voted for him this year said they wanted “complete and total upheaval,” according to AP VoteCast, a broad survey of more than 120,000 voters. An additional 56% said they wanted “substantial change.”\nBut the past few days made clear the difficulty Trump could face in quickly fulfilling his goals, especially with Republicans holding only thin majorities in the House and the Senate. Some lawmakers already seem weary of the apparent lack of a unified strategy. \nSen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said the budget battle was “a valuable lesson in how to get our act together.”\n“There are no layups and it gets more complicated,\" he said. \nHow Trump's demands fell flat\nThe trouble started when top lawmakers released a copy of the bill, known as a continuing resolution, that was required to keep the federal government functioning until March. It wasn't the president-elect but Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a Trump confidant, who first began whipping up opposition to the legislation on social media by calling it excessive spending. \nTrump eventually waded into the fight. He ordered Republicans to cancel the bipartisan deal they had made with Democrats. And he demanded they increase the debt limit — the cap on how much the government can borrow — in hopes of preventing that thorny issue from coming up while he is in charge of the government.\nHe ratcheted up the pressure even as his demands shifted. First he wanted to eliminate the debt limit altogether. Then he wanted to suspend it until 2027. Then he floated an extension until 2029. \nIf there was a shutdown, Democratic President Joe Biden would take the blame, Trump insisted.\n“All Republicans, and even the Democrats, should do what is best for our Country, and vote “YES” for this Bill, TONIGHT!” Trump wrote Thursday, before a vote on a version of the bill that included a higher debt limit. \nInstead, 38 Republicans voted no. It was a stunning brush-off to Trump, whose power over his party has at times seemed near-absolute.\n\"Without this, we should never make a deal,\" he wrote on Truth Social, his social media site. \nIf he didn’t get what he wanted, Trump said, there should be a government shutdown. He also said members of his own party would face primary challenges if they refused to go along, saying “Republican obstructionists have to be done away with.\" He singled out Rep. Chip Roy of Texas by name and with insults.\nBut in the end, lawmakers left out that debt ceiling increase, and a final deal passed early Saturday.\nMusk and other Trump allies tried to frame it as a win because the final legislation was significantly slimmed down and omitted unpopular items such as a pay raise for members of Congress. Charlie Kirk, the prominent conservative activist, wrote on X that Trump “is already running Congress before he takes office!”\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said he had been in “constant contact” with Trump, who, he added was \"certainly happy about this outcome.”\nIf Trump agreed, he didn’t say so himself.\nAfter days of frequent social media messages, Trump again went silent on Friday. He did not offer a reaction to the final vote or issue any statements. Instead, he went golfing at his Florida resort.\nKaroline Leavitt, a spokesperson for Trump, said the president-elect helped prevent an original deal “full of Democrat pork and pay raises for members of Congress.” \n“In January, President Trump and DOGE will continue this important mission to cut the waste out of Washington, one bill at a time,” she said. DOGE is a reference to the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory panel that will be led by Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. \nMore clashes to come \nThe circus-like atmosphere of the funding fight was reminiscent of Trump’s first term. Back then, one budget standoff led to a government shutdown when Trump demanded money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. After 35 days — the longest shutdown in history — he agreed to a deal without the money he wanted.\nIt was a political low point for Trump, and 60% of Americans blamed him for the shutdown, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll at the time.\nTrump didn't stop trying to bend Republicans to his will then. He's certainly not going to do so now. \nHe is cranking up the pressure on his own party over his Cabinet picks, pushing reluctant Republican senators to get on board with some of his most controversial choices, such as anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as health secretary and then-Fox News host Pete Hegseth as defense secretary. \nThe spending debates next year seem certain to further test Trump's influence in the House. Many conservatives view the rapid growth of the federal debt as an existential threat to the country that must be addressed. But some Republicans fear a voter backlash if steep cuts are made to federal programs upon which Americans rely.\nConcerns about deficit spending could intensify if Trump pushes expensive tax cuts that he promised during the campaign, such as eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security and overtime pay. \nHe also wants to extend the tax cuts he signed into law in 2017 that are set to expire next year. He has called for further lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the United States. \nTrump has said he will pay for the dips in revenue with aggressive new tariffs that economists warn will lead to higher prices for consumers.\nRep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said reducing spending would likely continue to be a gulf between Trump and House Republicans.\n“That’s never been really a campaign promise of Trump, but it’s a big priority for House Republicans,” he said.\nThere was no sense that the animosity was dying down on Saturday. Some Republicans faulted the House leadership for not securing Trump's “blessing\" on the original deal. Democrats cast Trump as second fiddle to Musk.\nWhile Trump stayed quiet, Biden announced that he signed the budget legislation. \n\"This agreement represents a compromise, which means neither side got everything it wanted,\" he said. “But it rejects the accelerated pathway to a tax cut for billionaires that Republicans sought, and it ensures the government can continue to operate at full capacity.”\n___ Boak reported from West Palm Beach, Florida, and Colvin from New York.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day",
      "body": "\n\nHanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900.\nFor some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement.\n“This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness,” said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents.\n“The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other,” he said. “It’s others seeing you as you see yourself.”\nOne example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for a “cross cultural holiday celebration.\" The venue: Houston’s Holocaust museum.\nThe food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song “Hava Nagila.”\n“What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage,” said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston.\nRabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the party-goers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and “Anglo” Jews.\n“There’s too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos,” Tarlow said. “This is a way we can come together and show we support each other.”\nWhile Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism.\nRabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they’re visible through household windows and in public spaces.\n“The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it,” Hauer said.\n“It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world,” he added. “We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations.”\nHauer concurred with Stanton that this year’s overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is “an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith.”\nRabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time.\n\"Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it’s not taken for granted,” Seligson said. “One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly.”\nHe said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world.\n“There certainly is some apprehension,” Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. “Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past.”\n“What I’m hearing is there’s no way that we can’t,” he added. “The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever.”\nStanton concurred.\n“Through our history, we’ve been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard,” he said. “Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out.”\nWhy is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles, and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar.\nThe last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term “Chrismukkah” — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama “The O.C.” embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother.\nThis season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called “Leah’s Perfect Gift,” depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance, and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly.\nDespite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays.\n“The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah,” he said. “It’s a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish.” ___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "subhead": "Authorities in Nigeria say At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in the country, as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events",
      "body": "\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday.\nThe two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa’s most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\nTen people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church.\nThere was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said, pointing out that some had been waiting since the previous night.\n“The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,” Loveth Inyang, a witness. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge.\nThree people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. \n“The event had not even started when the rush began,” police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said.\nViral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said.\nThe church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises.\nAs the church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures.\nNigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy with the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures.\nThe recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday this week when a local foundation organized a well-attended funfair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state.\nAfter the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that prior permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized.\nThe current economic hardship under Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who promised “renewed hope” when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation that is at a 28-year high and the government’s economic policies that have pushed the local currency to record low against the dollar.\nFrustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot dead and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Albania’s prime minister says the government will shut down video service TikTok for one year, blaming it for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children",
      "body": "\n\nTIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania's prime minister said Saturday the government will shut down the video service TikTok for one year, blaming it for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children.\nAlbanian authorities held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents following the stabbing death of a teenager in mid-November by another teen after a quarrel that started on TikTok.\nPrime Minister Edi Rama, speaking at a meeting with teachers and parents, said TikTok “would be fully closed for all. ... There will be no TikTok in the Republic of Albania.\" Rama said the shutdown would begin sometime next year.\nIt was not immediately clear if TikTok has a contact in Albania.\n TikTok in an email response Saturday to a request for comment asked for “urgent clarity from the Albanian government” on the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had \"found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.”\nAlbanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. \nThere has been increasing concern from Albanian parents after reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok.\nTikTok's operations in China, where its parent company is based, are different, “promoting how to better study, how to preserve nature ... and so on,” according to Rama.\nAlbania is too small a country to impose on TikTok a change of its algorithm so that it does not promote “the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on,\" Rama’s office wrote in an email response to The Associated Press' request for comment. Rama's office said that in China TikTok \"prevents children from being sucked into this abyss.” \nAuthorities have set up a series of protective measures at schools, starting with an increased police presence, training programs and closer cooperation with parents.\nRama said Albania would follow how the company and other countries react to the one-year shutdown before deciding whether to allow the company to resume operations in Albania.\nNot everyone agreed with Rama’s decision to close TikTok.\n“The dictatorial decision to close the social media platform TikTok ... is a grave act against freedom of speech and democracy,” said Ina Zhupa, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party. “It is a pure electoral act and abuse of power to suppress freedoms.”\nAlbania holds parliamentary elections next year.\n___\nFollow Llazar Semini at https://x.com/lsemini\n\n",

      "subhead": "The final buzzer sounded, the South Bay Lakers had won a game and Bronny James seemed completely at ease",
      "body": "\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The final buzzer sounded Saturday, the South Bay Lakers had won a game and Bronny James seemed completely at ease.\nBig smile. Handshakes with everyone. Even did a little dance step as he got to the bench.\nLeBron James' oldest son made his peace long ago with the realization that he's going to be judged differently because of who his father is. Bronny James insists that doesn't bother him, saying Saturday at the G League Winter Showcase that he looks at the game differently — and still with some challenges — after suffering cardiac arrest on July 24, 2023.\n“I’ve become resilient over these past couple of years fighting through injuries, mental illness, stuff like that,\" James said. \"Just, you know, coming in and working every day and staying the course.”\nThe mental challenge, he said, stems largely from the scare of that day 17 months ago.\n“Trying to get past that,” James said. “It's difficult, but I'm trying to work at it every day.”\nHe suffered cardiac arrest during a practice session at the University of Southern California and needed a procedure to fix what eventually was diagnosed as a congenital heart defect, then missed several months of basketball while recovering. The NBA cleared him to participate fully in the league back in May, and the Los Angeles Lakers — his father’s team — drafted him with the 55th overall pick in June, eventually signing him to a four-year, $7.9 million contract.\nBronny James has appeared in seven games with the NBA's Lakers, making history by being part of the first on-court father-son duo in league history, and has spent time in the G League as well to continue his development. The Lakers have made no secret that James is a work in progress, and the 20-year-old doesn't hide from that reality either.\n“He’s got a lot of attention on him,” South Bay teammate Devonte’ Graham — a veteran of more than 300 NBA games — told ESPN in a televised postgame interview. “He knows how to deal with it. I think he’s been playing good.”\nJames' final numbers Saturday: six points, seven assists, four rebounds and a steal on 3-for-7 shooting in 25 minutes in South Bay's 120-104 victory over the Osceola Magic. The athleticism was on full display at times — he twice went into traffic for rebounds, simply going over the maze of people to emerge with the ball.\n“I’m just showing up every day, trying to get better every day, trying to learn every day and playing my game every day,” James said. “And I feel like that’s what is getting me to have fun and enjoy this sport that I love every day.”\nHe wondered in the immediate aftermath of the heart episode if he would be able to play the game, and there were plenty of doubters — and naysayers — when he was drafted after averaging 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in his only college season.\nThe noise from the outside, he said, “flies in one ear and out the other.” He is just happy to be playing, whether it's on a makeshift court inside an Orlando convention center on a Saturday afternoon or on the bright lights of the NBA stage.\n“My family, my parents, they are extremely thankful that I'm not only able to play basketball but also just walk around and speak to other people,” James said. “It's a blessing to be able to play this sport that I love. There's a chance I wasn't going to be able to. So, I wake up and I'm thankful for that every day.”\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n\n",

      "subhead": "Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with “The Apprentice,” is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration",
      "body": "\n\nWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with “The Apprentice,” is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration.\n“With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,” Trump announced Saturday. \nBurnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like “Survivor” and “The Voice,” but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for “The Apprentice,” which first aired on NBC in 2004. \nTrump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name — though Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run. \nThe selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both — including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekend,” and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz. \nTrump’s first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on “The Apprentice” and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a “star.” \nAlmost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump’s television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building’s lobby. \n“Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,\" Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits before adding, “most notably, ‘The Apprentice’\" and noting that Burnett “has won 13 Emmy Awards!” \nLater Saturday, Trump announced in a separate statement that he was picking casino magnate Tilman Fertitta as his choice to be U.S. ambassador to Italy. \nBurnett, meanwhile, will be a special envoy, posts usually filled by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East — where Trump has already said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a “special relationship” with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts. \nBut Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.\nTrump previously announced on Dec. 2 that he was picking billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens for the more standard role of U.S. ambassador to Britain. That might raise questions about how a special U.K. envoy could overlap duties, but the president-elect said in his statement that Burnett “will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.”\n\n",

Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip. \nBut workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers — many of whom have voted to unionize — even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them. Starbucks long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year. \nWhy are the strikes happening now?\nStrikes — particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity — can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers. \nBoth Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans. \nEmployees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe’s and the outdoor equipment company REI. \nBut turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.\nJohn Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are “desperate” to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration. \n“The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. “If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.”\nHowever, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer. \nTeamster-led strikes at Amazon\n\nThe Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters. \nThe prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking. \nThe union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries. \nThat type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry — transportation and trucking — that’s dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon’s ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees. \nMeanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a “false narrative” about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers. \nIn September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub. \nThe Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union. \nAmazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union. \nAmazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company. \nContract negotiations at Starbucks\nUnlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. \nBut Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, said the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. \nThe union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. \nIn launching the strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, Workers United said Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years. \nUnion leaders said the strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver, Pittsburgh and Columbus Ohio with plans for baristas to join the picket lines in New Jersey, New York, Philadelphia, and St. Louis on Sunday.\nWithout providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike.\nStarbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.\nStarbucks workers walked off the job on two occasions last year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.\nPatricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office. \nTrump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his “commitments are to the working class,” Campos-Medina said. \n___\nDee-Ann Durbin in Detroit contributed to this story. \n\n",

      "body": "\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) — Lamar Jackson was solid in Baltimore's biggest game of the season so far.\nThen, after one of the star quarterback's rare slip-ups, one of his teammates delivered the play of the day.\nJackson threw three touchdown passes and Marlon Humphrey scored on a fourth-quarter interception return to help the Ravens pull even with Pittsburgh atop the AFC North with a 34-17 victory over the Steelers on Saturday.\nPittsburgh (10-5) would have clinched the division with a victory, but now the teams are deadlocked after the Ravens (10-5) won for just the second time in the last 10 games in this series. Baltimore clinched a playoff berth. The Steelers had already done so.\n“It was cool to get a pick-6, but clinching a spot in the playoffs, to beat the Steelers, I'm just happy that the guys came in, put in the work, and we just took care of business,” Humphrey said. “I felt that this team has had our number over the years. Just take care of business, man. I felt like the performance we put on wasn't perfect, but I felt like that's what we were supposed to do.”\nRussell Wilson threw two touchdown passes, the second of which tied the game at 17 with 5:14 left in the third quarter. Jackson answered with a 7-yard scoring strike to Mark Andrews, and after Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs, a 44-yard run by Derrick Henry put the Ravens in the red zone.\nThat drive came to nothing when Jackson was intercepted for just the fourth time this season, but then Humphrey — who was celebrating the recent birth of his son Duke — picked off Wilson and went 37 yards to the end zone to give Baltimore a cushion in a series that’s been razor-thin of late. The previous nine games between the Steelers and Ravens were decided by seven points or fewer.\n“My whole family's in town to help out with my wife and everything,” Humphrey said. “I was texting her before. I'm supposed to go pick her up from the hospital, discharge her with the baby. So there's a lot of just great things that happened this week.”\nJackson improved to 2-4 against Pittsburgh as a starter. This was his first time facing the Steelers at home since 2020.\n“I feel like we've been busting our behind all season long, had ups and downs throughout this whole season, but to clinch a playoff against a great team like that, that's great,” Jackson said. “That means we're moving in the right direction.”\nHenry rushed for 162 yards.\nPittsburgh entered the game with a plus-18 margin in turnovers, but the Ravens had the edge in that department Saturday. Baltimore recovered three of its own fumbles and had two big takeaways.\n“We didn’t control the run game. We never did. When you don’t, you’ve got to do some splash plays or win the turnover battle in a significant way, and we didn’t do that either,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “There were some balls on the ground that we didn’t get. Then obviously we turned the ball over going in -- it took seven points off the board -- and they had a pick-6. The rest is history, as they say.”\nJackson found Isaiah Likely for a 9-yard touchdown to open the scoring. Wilson answered with a 1-yard scoring pass to MyCole Pruitt, and the Steelers appeared poised to take the lead when the veteran quarterback broke loose for a 19-yard run in Baltimore territory. \nBut Ar'Darius Washington delivered a punishing hit on Wilson at the end of that play, jarring the ball loose. Kyle Van Noy recovered for the Ravens at the Baltimore 4.\nThe Ravens then drove 96 yards and took a 14-7 lead on Jackson's 14-yard touchdown toss to Rashod Bateman.\nWilson threw a 12-yard TD to Cordarrelle Patterson to tie it in the third.\nMilestones\nJackson set a team record with his 37th touchdown pass of the season, and he's now up to a career high of 3,787 yards.\nRavens receiver Zay Flowers had five catches for 100 yards, surpassing 1,000 on the season.\nHenry has exceeded 1,500 yards rushing for the fourth time. He's now up to 1,636, a mark he's only surpassed once — in his 2,027-yard campaign of 2020.\nInjuries\nSteelers CB Joey Porter Jr. injured his calf, and WR Ben Skowronek hurt his hip. ... Baltimore RB Justice Hill left the game because of a concussion.\nUp next\n\nBoth teams play on Christmas Day to wrap up stretches of three games in 11 days. Pittsburgh hosts Kansas City on Wednesday and Baltimore plays at Houston.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — First baseman Paul Goldschmidt and the New York Yankees agreed Saturday to a $12.5 million, one-year contract, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press.\nThe person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the agreement was subject to a successful physical.\nGoldschmidt would become the Yankees' fourth significant addition since Juan Soto's departure for the New York Mets after left-hander Max Fried, closer Devin Williams and outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger. Goldschmidt's addition likely means Bellinger will be primarily an outfielder.\nThe Yankees still may be looking for a third baseman along with left-handed relievers: There are no lefty relievers on their 40-man roster.\nA seven-time All-Star, four-time Gold Glove winner and the 2022 NL MVP, the right-handed Goldschmidt joins fellow MVPs Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton and Bellinger on the Yankees. Goldschmidt became a free agent after completing a $130 million, five-year contract with St. Louis.\nHe spent his first eight seasons with Arizona and his last six with the Cardinals, slumping to a career-low .245 average last season with 22 homers and 65 RBIs. He revived his numbers late in the season, batting .283 with seven homers and 25 RBIs from July 28 on.\nGoldschmidt hit .295 with five homers, 16 RBIs and a .839 OPS in 167 plate appearances against left-handers this year and .230 with 17 homers, 49 RBIs and a .675 OPS in 487 plate appearances against righties.\nHe is a .289 career hitter with 362 homers and 1,187 RBIs for the Diamondbacks (2011-18) and Cardinals (2019-24). Goldschmidt batted .317 with 35 homers, 115 RBIs and a .981 OPS in 2022.\nNew York also finalized a one-year contract with right-hander Jonathan Loáisiga, a deal that includes a club option for 2026. Pitching coach Matt Blake said this week the 30-year-old right-hander could return in late April or May from Tommy John surgery last May 1.\n“I imagine him being one of the high-leverage guys,” Blake said. “Obviously, we got to take some time to get him right, make sure we don’t rush him into competition.”\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\n\n",

      "headline": "It's eggnog season. The boozy beverage dates back to medieval England but remains a holiday hit",
      "subhead": "It's eggnog season",
      "body": "\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — At Scoma’s Restaurant in San Francisco, this holiday season 's batch of eggnog began 11 months ago.\nThe process typically starts in late January, just after the previous year's celebrations are over. Nearly a thousand egg yolks, gallons upon gallons of heavy cream and roughly $1,000 worth of vanilla beans are mixed with sugar and a mega-cocktail of sherry, brandy and aged rum. The concoction is then stored at 34 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) and and gets stirred weekly for months.\nIs it worth the wait? Customer Phil Kenny seems to think so.\n“It’s a wonderful, specialty drink,\" Kenny said of Scoma's recipe, which has been honed in recent years to take advantage of the boozy beverage’ s aging process. \"This takes eggnog to a different level.”\nKenny and his wife, Laurie, aren't the only ones enjoying it this year.\n“A drink that you would sort of associate with grandma and grandpa on the holidays has become like a cult favorite here,\" Gordon Drysdale, Scoma’s culinary director, said earlier this month. \"We did not ever anticipate people actually being mad at us because we didn’t have it.”\nEggnog's roots date back to medieval England and a drink called “posset,” which included hot milk or cream, alcohol and spices. Recipes have evolved in the centuries since then, and non-dairy and alcohol-free options abound in recent years. But some — like the formula for the famous eggnog daiquiri at Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop in New Orleans — stay the same, and remain secret.\n“I like to say it’s a little Christmas magic,\" said Jamie Gourges, marketing manager for the open-air bar in the city's iconic French Quarter. “We do not disclose any of our recipes at any point but it is delicious.”\nGourges will say, though, that theirs is made fresh each morning from right after Thanksgiving until Three Kings Day, also known as Epiphany, on Jan. 6. It's a tradition going back some 20 years at an establishment that was built in the early 1700s. Naturally, it's haunted by French pirate and privateer Jean Lafitte, who based his smuggling operations near New Orleans.\nTerry Wittmer, who lives in the Big Easy, is a regular customer and loves the holiday season at the bar.\n“It tastes like Christmas. It’s a little cinnamon-y. It’s smooth and if you drink it too fast you might get a brain freeze,” Wittmer said. “I live a block away so I’m here every day but I’m happier during Christmas.”\nEven for tourists who came for the bar's signature \"purple drank” daiquiri, the holiday beverage beckons.\n\"It’s not going to have a problem going down, let’s put it that way,” Cheryl Abrigo of Florida said as she sipped hers.\n___\nSmith reported from New Orleans, and Dazio reported from Los Angeles.\n\n",

      "headline": "Jeremiyah Love overcomes injury and illness to propel Notre Dame into 1st Sugar Bowl since 2007",
      "subhead": "Jeremiyah Love spent two weeks off battling a knee injury and an illness",
      "body": "\n\nSOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) — Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love wasted no time sending a message to his teammates Friday night.\nNothing was going to derail the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish in the College Football Playoff. Not chilly weather, not a motivated opponent ready to prove it belonged and certainly not an injury or even a lingering illness to the team's top runner.\nNow, with 12 more days for the second-year speedster to rest and recover before the seventh-seeded Fighting Irish face second-seeded Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, Love could be much closer to optimal speed when Notre Dame returns to action Jan. 1.\n“I probably sound pretty terrible, but I came off of a little injury. I’m sick,” he said before explaining why he slowed down at the end of the run that matched the longest in Irish history. “I was just out of breath. I was gassed.”\nAt 6 feet, 210 pounds, Love doesn't necessarily look like the model Missouri Class 5 100-meter champ. But looks are deceiving in this case, and Love has been showing the college football world all season just how dangerous he can be — even with a bad wheel.\nHe used most of the two weeks between Notre Dame's regular-season finale Nov. 30 and the playoff opener rehabbing the left knee he hurt against Southern California. Then, he was struck with an undisclosed illness.\nSo when Love ran through the Notre Dame Stadium tunnel for the first CFP game ever played on a college campus, he was nowhere near full strength against the nation's top run defense.\nIt didn't matter. \nAfter losing a yard on his first carry, Love took his second handoff, ran through a tackle at the line of scrimmage and sped past the other defenders for a 98-yard TD run — the longest in playoff history — as he watched the chase play out on the video board.\n“I’ve got the best view in the house. Every time I hand him the ball, I’m just watching, like what’s he going to do now?” Irish quarterback Riley Leonard said after the 27-17 victory over 10th-seeded Indiana. “It’s the little things. It’s that second or third down where he’s stiff-arming guys and getting first downs for us. He’s just a freak athlete.”\nLove finished the game with only seven more carries for 10 more yards, playing sparingly after he appeared to reinjure the left knee when he landed awkwardly after attempting to hurdle an Indiana defender later in the first half.\nBut the victory gives him more time to get healthier for Georgia's run defense, which allows nearly 130 yards rushing per game. Notre Dame (12-1) faces the Southeastern Conference champion Bulldogs (11-2) — just like they did in 1980 when Georgia's victory gave the program the second of its four national championships.\nThe Bulldogs have won all three games in the series against the storied Irish but might be without starting quarterback Carson Beck, who injured his throwing elbow in the SEC championship game.\nRegardless, Notre Dame thinks it's time for a change in this series as it attempts to produce the first 13-win season in school history. Notre Dame also is trying to end a 36-year drought without a national championship, the school's longest since winning its first title in 1924.\n“We wouldn’t be in this situation if we didn’t have 12 wins, so I’m grateful to be part of a program and a team that has been able to accomplish this,\" coach Marcus Freeman said. “But you know I’m greedy, and my focus is — although I don’t want their focus to be on it — my focus is going to be on find a way to get 13. That’s what matters.\"\nIt matters to Love, too, as he and the Irish prepare their encore performance.\n“Like I say, if we didn’t have a rushing quarterback, how many more touchdowns would this guy have?” Leonard said. “He'd be in (the Heisman Trophy) conversations nationwide. Obviously, I think people are starting to see how special he is.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "headline": "Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, baseball's stolen base king, has died at 65",
      "subhead": "Baseball Hall of Famer and stolen base king Rickey Henderson has died",
      "body": "\n\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, the brash speedster who shattered stolen base records and redefined baseball's leadoff position, has died. He was 65.\nHenderson died on Friday. The Athletics said Saturday they were “shocked and heartbroken by his passing,\" but did not specify a cause of death.\nKnown as baseball's “Man of Steal,” Henderson had a lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments over his nomadic 25-year career — an MVP, 10 All-Star selections, two World Series titles and a Gold Glove award.\n“Rickey was simply the best player I ever played with. He could change the outcome of a game in so many ways,\" said Don Mattingly, Henderson's teammate with the New York Yankees from 1985-89. \"It puts a smile on my face just thinking about him. I will miss my friend.”\nIt was stealing bases where Henderson made his name and dominated the sport like no other.\nHe broke through with 100 steals in his first full season in the majors in 1980, topping Ty Cobb's AL single-season record with Billy Martin's “Billy Ball” Oakland Athletics. He barely slowed playing for nine franchises over the next two decades. He broke Lou Brock's single-season record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982 and led the league in steals for seven straight seasons and 12 overall.\nHenderson surpassed Brock's career record when he stole his 939th base on May 1, 1991, for Oakland, and famously pulled third base out of the ground and showed it off to the adoring crowd before giving a speech that he capped by saying: “Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but today I am the greatest of all time.”\nHenderson finished his career with 1,406 steals. His 468-steal edge over Brock matches the margin between Brock and Jimmy Rollins, who is in 46th place with 470.\n“He’s the greatest leadoff hitter of all time, and I’m not sure there’s a close second,” former A's executive Billy Beane said of Henderson.\nIn September, Henderson insisted he would have had many more steals in his career and in the record-breaking 1982 season if rules introduced in 2023 to limit pickoff throws and increase the size of bases had overlapped with his career.\n“If I was playing today, I would get 162, right now, without a doubt,\" he said. \"Because if they had had that rule, you can only throw over there twice, you know how many times they would be throwing over there twice and they’d be going, ‘Ah, (shoot), can y’all send him to third? Give him two bases and send him to third.’ That would be me.”\nHe even predicted how he could still be stealing more bases than the current major leaguers even 20-plus years post-retirement: \"If they’re stealing 40-50 bases right now I’d lead the league.”\nHenderson’s accomplishment that record-breaking day in 1991 was slightly overshadowed that night when Nolan Ryan threw his record seventh career no-hitter. Henderson already had been Ryan’s 5,000th career strikeout victim, which led him to say, “If you haven’t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you’re nobody.”\nThat was clearly not the case for Henderson. He is also the career leader in runs scored with 2,295 and in leadoff home runs with 81, ranks second to Barry Bonds with 2,190 walks and is fourth in games played (3,081) and plate appearances (13,346). He finished his career with 3,055 hits over 25 seasons spent with Oakland, the Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim, the New York Mets, Seattle, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nHe fittingly finished his career with the Dodgers at age 44 in 2003 by scoring a run in his final play on a major league field.\nHenderson is the third prominent baseball Hall of Famer with ties to the Bay Area who died this year, following the deaths in June of former Giants stars Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda.\nHenderson was the rare position player who hit from the right side and threw with his left arm — but then again, everything about Henderson was unique.\nHe batted out of an extreme crouch, making for a tighter strike zone that contributed to his high walk total. He struck fear in opponents with his aggressive leads off first, his fingers twitching between his legs inside his batting gloves as he eyed the pitcher and the next base.\nBorn on Christmas Day in 1958 in Chicago in the back of his parents' Chevy, Henderson grew up in Oakland and developed into a star athlete. He played baseball, basketball and football at Oakland Tech High School and was a highly sought-after football recruit who could have played tailback at Southern California — where he likely would have eventually had the chance to run alongside football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen.\nBut Henderson said his mother loved baseball and thought it would be the safer career in a decision that proved to be prescient.\n“She didn’t want her baby to get hurt,” Henderson told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019. “I was mad, but she was smart. Overall, with the career longevity and the success I had, she made the right decision. Some of the players in football now have short careers and they can barely move around when they’re done.”\nHenderson was selected in the fourth round of the 1976 amateur draft by the hometown A's and made his big league debut in 1979 with two hits — and, of course, one stolen base.\nHe became a star for the A's the following season and remained in Oakland through 1984 before being traded to the Yankees. Henderson was part of some talented teams in New York that never made the postseason. In 1985, he scored 146 runs in 143 games to go along with a league-leading 80 steals and 24 homers, helping start the \"80-20 club\" that season with Cincinnati's Eric Davis.\nHenderson was traded back to Oakland in June 1989, leading to his greatest successes. He topped the AL that season with 113 runs, 126 walks and 77 steals, was named the ALCS MVP and helped lead the A's to the World Series title in the earthquake-interrupted Bay Bridge series by sweeping the Giants.\nHenderson then won the AL MVP the following season for Oakland before the A's lost the World Series to Cincinnati.\n“I traded Rickey Henderson twice and brought him back more times than that,” former A's general manager Sandy Alderson said. \"He was the best player I ever saw play. He did it all — hit, hit for power, stole bases, and defended — and he did it with a flair that enthused his fans and infuriated his opponents. But everyone was amused by his personality, style, and third-person references to himself. He was unique in many ways.\n“Rickey stories are legion, legendary, and mostly true. But behind his reputation as self-absorbed was a wonderful, kind human being who loved kids. His true character became more evident over time. Nine different teams, one unforgettable player.”\nHenderson set the career steals record in 1991 and then was traded two years later to Toronto, where he won his second World Series. He spent the final decade of his career bouncing around the majors and still led the AL with 66 steals and 118 walks at age 39 with Oakland in 1998. \nIn 2017, the A's named their playing surface “Rickey Henderson Field” at the Oakland Coliseum in his honor.\n“When you’re old and grey, sitting around with your buds talking about your career in baseball, you are going to talk about Rickey,\" said Ron Guidry, another of Henderson's former Yankees teammates. \"He was just amazing to watch. There were great outfielders. There were great base stealers. There were great home run hitters. Rickey was a combination of all of those players. He did things out there on the field that the rest of us dreamed of.”\n___\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley contributed to this report.\n___\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Jaydon Blue had the biggest run in the biggest game of the season so far for Texas. He had to fight through a nagging ankle injury and fumble problems to do it.\nBlue ran for 146 yards, dashing 77 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to help the Longhorns beat Clemson 38-24 on Saturday in the first round of the expanded College Football Playoff.\nBlue was first thrust into the starting role when training camp injuries knocked out C.J. Baxter and Christian Clark for the season. Blue missed a game with the ankle injury, then saw his carries reduced over several games because of fumble problems. \nTexas (12-2), the No. 5 seed, advanced to the Jan. 1 Peach bowl to play Big 12 champion and No. 4 seed Arizona State.\n“You can’t win (the championship) if you don’t win the first one,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We did that.”\nBlue already had a 38-yard touchdown earlier in the game. The second one came after Clemson had rallied from down 31-10 to within 31-24 on Cade Klubnik's third touchdown pass.\nBlue scored on 38-yard cut-and-dash burst in the second quarter. On the second touchdown, he dove into the line, shook a tackler, and then outraced three more to the end zone with just 11 minutes left.\nHe clutched the ball tightly to his chest when a defender tried to rip it away.\n“It was a sigh of relief after everything I’ve been going through,” Blue said. “I stayed patient, I saw a crease and it was everything (open) from there.”\nSarkisian said Blue never lost the trust of the team.\n“Our staff, his teammates, believed in him,\" Sarkisian said. “I just gave him a big hug and told him how proud I was.”\nQuintrevion Wisner added 110 yards rushing and two first-half touchdowns for Texas. Quinn Ewers passed for 202 yards and a touchdown.\nKlubnik, who grew up in Austin, passed for 336 yards and rallied the Tigers (10-4) in the second half against a Texas defense that had given up just four passing touchdowns all season. \n“We just got ourselves in too big a hole in the first half. Everything was uphill.” Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. “We just put it in Cade’s hands and let it rip.\"\nThe runner-up in the Southeastern Conference, Texas is the only one of last season’s four playoff teams to make the new 12-team field. Clemson won the ACC championship to make the playoff. The Tigers were the No. 12 seed in their first appearance since 2020 and seventh overall.\n\"It's not easy to get on this stage (again), and they earned it,\" Sarkisian said. “It think college football got this one right. This idea of a home playoff game with a 12-team format was pretty special.” \nTakeaways\nClemson: The Tigers had three big fourth-down chances in the fourth quarter. They turned the first one into a touchdown when Klubnik threw to T.J. Moore. But they came up short on the next two. Keith Adams Jr. was stuffed at the Texas 1 and Klubnik pass at the Texas 26 was incomplete with just over a minute left.\n“We've got big people,” Sarkisian said. “And they know how to play a physical brand of football.”\nTexas: The Longhorns had some injury scares that could be worrisome with more games ahead. Wisner, starting offensive tackle Cam Williams and center Jake Majors all left the field in two plays in the second quarter. Sarkisian said the coaching staff opted to keep Wisner and Majors out in the second half. Williams needed help to get off the field and will have tests on his knee overnight.\nReceiving record\nTexas tight end Gunnar Helm caught six passes for 77 yards, including a 19-yard touchdown that saw him reach high and still get his feet down in the end zone. He has 55 catches on the season, breaking the previous school record for tight ends. The record was 54, set last season by J.T. Sanders.\nUp next\nClemson will try to defend its ACC title next season and earn its eighth playoff berth.\nTexas moves on to face Arizona State in the next round. The Longhorns left the Big 12 before Arizona State joined that league this season.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "subhead": "Tiger Woods and his 15-year-old son Charlie are tied for the lead in the PNC Championship",
      "body": "\n\nORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — Tiger Woods and 15-year-old son Charlie ran off five straight birdies on the back nine Saturday for a 13-under 59 in the scramble format, giving them a share of the lead in the PNC Championship in Woods' first competition since back surgery in September.\nWoods said he scheduled that surgery — the sixth on his lower back in the last 10 years — to be sure he recovered in time to play with his son for the fifth straight year.\nThis is the first time they have shared the lead after the opening round, joined by the last two champions — Bernhard Langer and son Jason, and Vijay Singh and son Qass.\nWoods hit an array of good shots, including a wedge to inches on the short par-4 seventh, but otherwise downplayed his game by suggesting he still had a lot of rust. This was more about spending 36 holes on a brisk day at the Ritz-Carlton Club Orlando with his son, a sophomore at Benjamin School in North Palm Beach.\nHis daughter, Sam, caddied for her father for the second straight year. Their mother, Elin, was among those in the gallery in a tournament that is all about family.\n“We're trying to pull off each and every shot for each other, and to ham-and-egg,” Woods said. “And I think we did that great pretty much the entire day. We picked each other up, which was great. And Charlie made pretty much most of the putts today.”\nIt helped playing in the same group with former British Open champion Justin Leonard and his son, Luke, a senior and teammate with Charlie at Benjamin School.\nLanger extended his astonishing record on the PGA Tour Champions this year by winning for an 18th consecutive season. He and his son made eight birdies in a nine-hole stretch in the middle of the round, and they had an eagle on the 14th hole.\nSingh and his son, who won this event in 2022, shot 28 on the back nine.\n“There's so many teams in the hunt,” Langer said. “It's anybody's game that is within three or four shots of the leaders, which is most of the field.”\nPadraig Harrington and son Paddy, and Tom Lehman and son Sean, were at 12-under 60. The Lehmans looked to be leading when they were around the green on the par-5 18th, but then it took them four shots to get down in the scramble format, taking bogey.\nHaving Team Woods in the mix is enough to get attention.\n“It's great for the tournament and happy for them,” Langer said. “Should be fun for the crowd tomorrow to come out and watch everybody play.”\nWoods hasn't competed since the British Open in July.\nFor Team Woods, it's a matter of not looking too far ahead. The father knows that all too well with his record-tying 82 titles on the PGA Tour. The son got a lesson in that this summer.\nCharlie Woods qualified for his first U.S. Junior Amateur, making it to Oakland Hills but not staying very long. He shot rounds of 82-80 and didn't make it to match play. He also fell short in Monday qualifying for the Cognizant Classic on the PGA Tour and U.S. Open qualifying.\nBut he said the U.S. Junior was his biggest learning moment.\n“It's about focusing on my playing,” Charlie said. “I was so focused on winning and how I played that it kind of crept into how am I going to win instead of how I’m going to play the shot. And it kind of built up and that caused two very, very bad rounds of golf. But live and learn.”\nHis father listened to the answer and nodded.\n“Learn,” Woods said.\nThe PNC Championship is for players who won a major or The Players Championship and a family member. Annika Sorenstam is playing with her son, while Nelly Korda is playing with her father. Steve Stricker — winner of seven senior majors — is playing with daughter Izzy, a freshman at Wisconsin.\nKorda dazzled with a fairway metal out of the sand on the par-5 14th to set up eagle. Team Korda was four shots behind.\n___\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\n",

      "headline": "Isolated Chicago communities secure money for a coveted transit project before Trump takes office",
      "subhead": "Decades after a former Chicago mayor pledged to extend transit to the city’s far South Side, the federal government is committing to the massive project just before President Joe Biden leaves office",
      "body": "\n\nCHICAGO (AP) — Adella Bass dropped her in-person college classes because it was just too hard to get there from the far South Side of Chicago, where the city's famous elevated train doesn't run. And it can take her nearly two hours to get to the hospital where she is treated for a heart condition.\nBut things are looking up, with bright red signs across the area boldly proclaiming, \"Ready, Set, Soon!” Next year, the city is poised to start making good on a decades-old promise to connect some of its most isolated, poor and polluted neighborhoods to the rest of the city through mass transit.\nThe Biden administration notified Congress last week that it would commit $1.9 billion toward a nearly $5.7 billion project to add four new L stations on the South Side, the Chicago system’s largest expansion project in history. The pledge, which the Federal Transit Administration is expected to formally sign before President Joe Biden leaves office in January, essentially locks in current and future funding.\nStill, Bass fears President-elect Donald Trump's administration might try to scuttle it.\nSignals abound to assure residents that the project is “a go,” said Bass, who is raising three young children and works on health equity issues that affect residents of a massive public housing development near her South Side home. \"But you just never know with Trump.”\nCould Trump slash transit funding?\nThe $1 trillion infrastructure plan Biden signed into law in 2021 focused far more heavily on transit than anything his predecessor advocated. That is why there has been a scramble to finalize some transit grants before Biden's term ends, including commitments last week for rapid transit upgrades in San Antonio and Salt Lake City.\nYonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute, said Trump unsuccessfully encouraged Congress in his first term to pass budgets eliminating funding for some new transit projects that hadn't secured their grant agreements. But it has been practically unheard of for administrations to claw back projects after they won final approval.\nSteve Davis, who handles transportation strategy for Smart Growth America, said Trump could try to redirect future competitive grants to prioritize highway construction over alternative transportation methods such as transit. He said Trump's Transportation Department could potentially slow down some allocations from already approved infrastructure projects but would have trouble halting them entirely.\n“If you're building an enormous $2 billion road widening, you need to know you're going to have money in year four or five and there's nothing a hostile administration could do to stop it,” Davis said.\nBringing back jobs through access\nOne of the communities that would be served by a new Chicago L station is Roseland, a once-thriving, predominantly Black business district that has fallen victim to the loss of manufacturing and a spike in crime. \nJervon Hicks, who spent many years in and out of jail on gun charges, turned his life around and ended up becoming a mentor for at-risk youth. The new station could help quicken the same transition for others, he said.\n“Roseland needs a makeover,” Hicks said. “We lack a pet store. We used to have a theater. Take some of these abandoned buildings and turn them into job opportunities.”\nUnlike the busy “Magnificent Mile” shopping district on Michigan Avenue in the downtown Chicago Loop, the business district on South Michigan Avenue in Roseland has fallen from more than 90% occupancy decades ago to around 10% now.\nAmong the surviving businesses is Edwards Fashions. Owner Ledall Edwards hopes transportation will spur more to return.\n“I don’t think it’ll get to the level it was back in the 1970s, but I think the environment is going to improve because of the accessibility,\" he said. “You’re going to be able to get people here in this area much faster.”\nRogers Jones, who for 30 years has run the Youth Peace Center next to the future train station, said he can't wait for the transformation.\n“The community is going to change,” Jones said. “It’s going to be a vibrant community, and people are excited. I know I’m excited.”\nA 55-year-old promise\nFormer Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley told residents of Roseland and surrounding areas in 1969 that the L would eventually expand there. \nTammy Chase, a spokesperson for the Chicago Transit Authority, said the cost then would have been $114 million compared to around $5.7 billion now, a figure that would keep rising the longer construction is delayed.\nThe agency has hired a construction firm, opened a Roseland office in a former paint store and begun boarding up homes that will be demolished for the tracks to run through. Ground is expected to be broken in late 2025, Chase said.\nU.S. Rep. Mike Quigley of Illinois, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees transportation spending, points out Chicago's transit system survived wars and depression. It surely also can withstand a pandemic and a presidential administration with different priorities, he said.\n“The big infrastructure projects stand the test of time,” Quigley said. \"These ups and downs, you have to adjust to them, but you recognize transit always comes back. If transit doesn’t come back, it stymies opportunities going forward.”\n\n",

      "subhead": "The U.S. military says two U.S. Navy pilots have been shot down over the Red Sea in an apparent “friendly fire” incident",
      "body": "\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent “friendly fire” incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels.\nBoth pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become, with ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area.\nThe U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time of the friendly fire incident, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what the pilots' mission was and did not respond to questions from The Associated Press.\nThe F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea.\n“The guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,” Central Command said in a statement.\nFrom the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the “Red Rippers” of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia.\nIt wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. \nHowever, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past.\nSince the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. \nOn Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen which the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a “missile storage facility” and a “command-and-control facility,” without elaborating.\nHouthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. However, there were no images or information released regarding the strikes — which has happened previously when airstrikes hit vital facilities for the rebels. \nBrig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, released a prerecorded statement hours later in which he claimed the rebels launched eight drones and 17 cruise missiles in their attack. He also claimed without offering any evidence that the Houthis shot down the F/A-18, likely following a pattern of him making exaggerated claims. During the Eisenhower's deployment, he repeatedly falsely claimed the carrier had been struck by Houthi fire. \nThe Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage.\nIsrael’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians.\nThe Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.\nThe rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.\nThe Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.\nOn Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would act “forcefully” against the Houthis, as it has against other allies of Iran, “only in this case, we are not acting alone.”\n\n",

      "headline": "Caitlin Clark effect hasn't reversed the decades-long decline in girls basketball participation",
      "subhead": "Nebraska's third-largest high school decided not to play varsity girls basketball this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport",
      "body": "\n\nOMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Plunging participation in girls basketball led one of Nebraska's largest high schools to cancel its varsity team for the year. \nThe decision by Grand Island Senior High School — the state's third-largest with more than 2,600 students — reflects a national decline in participation in the girls sport, even as the popularity of women's basketball behind the likes of Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese has sent record numbers of fans flocking to arenas or tuning in on TV. \nSchools across the country have made similar choices, but that hasn’t made the move any easier for those passionate about Grand Island basketball.\n“We’ve seen the train coming. I mean we’ve been sitting on the tracks forever. But frankly, people just didn’t want to do the heavy lifting that was required,” said Jeremy Jensen, a former Grand Island mayor and high school soccer coach who wishes more had been done to build a sustainable girls basketball program.\nWhat happened in Grand Island?\nThe high school in the largely blue-collar city of 52,000 about 120 miles (190 kilometers) west of Omaha decided to cancel its varsity and junior varsity teams this year after no juniors or seniors went out for the sport.\nThe team suffered a series of lopsided losses, and with many young athletes choosing to specialize in one sport and other activities competing for girls' time, the school decided to focus on developing young players instead of putting a team of freshman and sophomores on the court. \nStill, the school's decision was jarring at a time when college and professional women's basketball has been surging in popularity, partly due to the phenomenal success of WNBA Indiana Fever guard Clark, who set records at the University of Iowa.\nKansas State University women’s basketball coach Jeff Mittie said more viewers doesn't necessarily mean more players.\n“Certainly in college, all of our games are on TV, easy for people to find, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re playing the sport,” Mittie said. \"It just means they’re interested in watching it.”\nA declining trend\nSince Clark was born 22 years ago, participation in girls high school basketball has dropped nearly 20% and the sport has fallen from most popular to number four behind volleyball, soccer and track and field, which all have seen double-digit surges in participation, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.\nEven as the basketball numbers have dropped, total participation in high school sports has grown, with more than 3.4 million girls competing in high school sports last year.\nLosing takes a toll\nIn the past few years in Grand Island, Jim Ward watched every player on his oldest daughter's middle school team quit basketball in high school, either to focus on another sport like volleyball or wrestling or because they lost interest. During that time, the high school girls team was losing games by margins of 70 points or more. \nThe team lost 43 of its last 44 varsity games and has not won more than three games in a season since 2016-17, with its last winning season in 2009-10.\n“If you’re Grand Island going into Omaha facing some kids that are going to go D-1 (Division I) and you can only keep up with them for the first half of the first quarter, would you want to play longer?” asked Ward, who serves on the booster club board and has a daughter on the team in 10th grade.\nKelli Jefferies knows success is possible in Grand Island because she led the school to its only state championship in 1979 as a player and racked up 231 victories over 33 years as coach before stepping down in 2012. \nBut Jefferies said she understands the current struggles.\n“When you’re not really able to compete and be competitive, you can see why kids don’t want to do it anymore,” Jefferies said. “That’s not fun for everyone, for coaches and players and anyone involved.\"\nCostly competition\nThe problems in Grand Island and elsewhere run much deeper than a losing record.\nIn some communities it can be hard for girls to find opportunities to compete and learn the game when they are young. Many families can't afford to invest the thousands of dollars and countless hours required to play club basketball to prepare them to compete in high school, putting them behind in development.\nAs teams get competitive earlier and earlier, girls might quit the sport if they are cut in grade school.\nFamilies in Grand Island who want their kids to compete at the highest levels of club sports must drive about two hours twice a week to Lincoln or Omaha for practices and again on the weekends for tournaments if they are not traveling farther to other cities. \nCan the sport recover?\nGrand Island’s current coach, Kathryn Langrehr, works with middle schoolers and offers free basketball clinics at all the city’s elementary schools to help build a pipeline of players for the sport.\nBut rebuilding could be challenging, especially given the pressure on kids to specialize in just one sport.\n“It kind of speaks to the world that we’re living in with club sports and specialization of sports, where kids want to participate or are only able to participate in one activity,\" said Jon Dolliver, who oversees basketball at the Nebraska School Activities Association. \nVolleyball in particular grew tremendously as the sport became much more visible on television and social media and the U.S. emerged as a world power. \nThe sport is especially popular in Nebraska, where Creighton University and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, the state system's flagship campus, are ranked in the collegiate top 10. Nebraska fell short in the national semifinals on Friday. Last year, 92,003 people filled Nebraska's football stadium to watch a volleyball match, setting a world record for attendance at a women's sporting event.\nBrandon Traudt's daughter was a strong basketball player in middle school after growing up alongside her brother Isaac, who now plays for Creighton, but she always preferred volleyball. She will soon pursue that passion at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.\n“I think girls just naturally — especially in the state of Nebraska — gravitate towards volleyball,” Traudt said. “Volleyball is just very, very good in this state.”\nMaybe the popularity of the WNBA and players like Clark could change the trends, but Ward, the Grand Island dad, can envision an 8-year-old telling her parents she wants to play basketball only to be told there is no time for that with volleyball and dance.\n“I think the Caitlin Clark thing — it’s tough to say if this third grader sees it that she’s just going to quit volleyball and start playing basketball now. I don’t know,\" Ward said.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — JuJu Watkins scored 25 points and No. 7 USC recovered from blowing a 18-point lead in the second half to beat Paige Bueckers and fourth-ranked UConn 72-70 on Saturday night.\nThe game was a rematch of last season's Elite Eight contest that the Huskies won and featured two of the best players in women's college basketball with All-Americans Bueckers and Watkins. The pair guarded each other for most of the game.\nBueckers finished with 22 points.\nWith the game tied at 67, Watkins passed the ball to Rayah Marshall for a layup with 1:21 left to give USC the lead.\nAfter a miss by the Huskies, Watkins was fouled with 31 seconds left. She missed the first of two free throws as the ball sat on the rim for a few seconds before falling off. She made the second to give the Trojans (11-1) a 70-67 advantage. \nUConn (10-2), which trailed 51-33 in the third quarter before rallying, answered with a basket by Sarah Strong to get within one four seconds later.\nWatkins then hit two free throws with 19.5 seconds left to make it 72-69.\nThe Huskies had one last chance to tie when Strong was fouled shooting a 3-pointer with 5 seconds left. She made the first free throw, but missed the second. The freshman missed the third intentionally and UConn got the rebound. It eventually went out to Strong, whose desperation heave at the buzzer was off.\nTakeaways\nUSC: This was the Trojans' first test since losing to Notre Dame on Nov. 23. Now they face three ranked Big Ten teams in their next four games.\nUConn: This was the second top-10 team the Huskies have faced this season and they are now 0-2 after also falling to Notre Dame. \nKey moment\nEarlier in the third quarter, Watkins blocked Bueckers' shot then took the ball to the other end and scored after a going through her legs with UConn's star guarding her.\nKey stat\nA game after hitting a school-record 20 3-pointers, UConn was just 6 for 23 from behind the 3-point arc.\nUp next\nUSC: hosts Michigan on Dec. 29.\nUConn: hosts Providence on Dec. 29.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "subhead": "German authorities say they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged about the five people killed",
      "body": "\n\nMAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — German authorities said they received tipoffs last year about the suspect in a car attack at a Christmas market in Magdeburg as more details emerged on Sunday about the five people killed.\nAuthorities have identified the suspect as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Police haven’t publicly named the suspect, in line with privacy rules, but some German news outlets have identified him as Taleb A. and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy.\nAuthorities say he does not fit the usual profile of perpetrators of extremist attacks. The man described himself as an ex-Muslim who was highly critical of Islam and in many posts on social media expressed support for the far-right anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. \nHe is being held in custody as authorities investigate him.\n\"This perpetrator acted in an unbelievably cruel and brutal manner — like an Islamist terrorist, although he was obviously ideologically an Islamophobe,” Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said Sunday. \nThe suspect originally lived in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where he completed his specialist training in Stralsund and also came to the attention of authorities due to threatening criminal acts, the state interior minister, Christian Pegel, said Sunday.\nIn a dispute over the recognition of examination results, he threatened members of the state medical association with an act that would attract international attention, triggering an investigation and a search of his home, the dpa news agency reported, citing Pegel. No evidence was found of real preparations for an attack but a court found him guilty in 2013 of threatening an attack.\nThat was followed by other threats he made, Pegel said.\nThe head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in an interview on the German broadcaster ZDF on Saturday that his office received a tipoff from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, which led authorities to launch “appropriate investigative measures.”\n“The man also published a huge number of posts on the internet. He also had contact with various authorities, made insults and even threats. However, he was not known to have committed acts of violence,” said Münch, whose office is the German equivalent of the FBI.\nHe said that the warnings, however, proved to be very unspecific.\nThe Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also said it received a tipoff about the suspect in the late summer of last year.\n“This was taken seriously, like every other of the numerous tips,” the office said on X on Saturday. But it also noted that it is not an investigative authority and that it referred the information to the responsible authorities. It gave no other details. \nThe Central Council of Ex-Muslims said in a statement that the suspect had “terrorized” them for years as it expressed shock at the attack.\n“He apparently shared beliefs from the far-right spectrum of the AfD and believed in a large-scale conspiracy aimed at Islamizing Germany. His delusional ideas went so far that he assumed that even organizations critical of Islamism were part of the Islamist conspiracy,” said the statement. \nThe group's chairwoman, Mina Ahadi, said in the same statement: “At first we suspected that he might be a mole in the Islamist movement. But now I think he is a psychopath who adheres to ultra-right conspiracy ideologies.”\nPolice in Magdeburg, the capital of the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Sunday that those who died were four women aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy.\nAuthorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond.\nThe suspect was on Saturday evening brought before a judge, who behind closed doors ordered him to be kept in custody on allegations of murder and attempted murder. He is facing a possible indictment. \nThe horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany makes it likely that migration will remain a key issue as the country heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. A deadly knife attack by a suspected Islamic extremist from Syria in Solingen in August pushed the issue to the top of the agenda, and led the government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz to tighten border security measures.\nRight-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now.\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union’s migration policies and described it as a “terrorist act.”\nAt an annual press conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orbán insisted that “there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.”\n___\nGera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

      "body": "\n\nSURIN ISLANDS, Thailand (AP) — When Hook was a child, he started his days by jumping off the boat that his family lived on and into the ocean. By age 3, he could already swim and dive in shallow waters. His home was a kabang, a boat, that his family sailed in Thailand’s southern waters. The ocean was his backyard.\nNow Hook, whose full name is Suriyan Klathale, lives on land like the rest of his community, a people known as the Moken. The recollections of his childhood, which many Moken of his generation still have, are mostly just memories.\nThe community, a group of indigenous people from Thailand and Myanmar, came to worldwide attention for its members' understanding of waves when the Indian Ocean Tsunami struck in December 2004 and killed more than 200,000 people. The few tourists who happened to be on the islands inhabited by the Moken survived because locals knew when they saw the water recede that people needed to get to higher ground.\nToday, things are different and changing fast. This once free-sailing people have been grounded by powerful forces of change.\nHow do you hold onto tradition when everything is working against it?\nThe Moken are one of the various tribal groups and indigenous communities not formally recognized by the Thai government. For years, activists from these communities have tried to push for formal recognition with a bill that would help them hold on to traditions.\nBut as recently as October, the latest draft of this proposed bill, called the Protection and Promotion of Ethnic Groups’ Way of Life, was tabled by Parliament. The bill would legally guarantee these communities' basic rights, such as health care, education and land, as well as provide government support to preserve their ethnic identities. \nFor the Moken, the kabang and their way of living on the ocean are something they hope the law could help preserve. The wooden boat, with a distinctive curve that juts out from its bow and a pavilion set in the middle, is central to the Moken’s identity. “It’s like a lifetime of a person, of a family,\" Hook said. “In the past, we lived and died on that boat.”\nMultiple generations could live on a kabang, which were much bigger in the past. The parents would stay in the middle of the boat; their married children lived at the front until they built their own boat.\nTat, an elder in the Moken community who uses only one name, said that a Moken became an adult when he could build a boat. It meant he was capable of starting a family. \nToday, though, almost no one lives on a boat. Narumon Arunotai, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok who has worked with the Moken and other indigenous communities for decades, said the shift toward permanent dwelling on land had already started more than 40 years ago.\nIt was a gradual shift, driven both by stricter border controls as well as the inability to get the wood necessary to build the kabangs. Further, the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 destroyed many of the traditional boats. The change to dwelling on land has happened with other communities known colloquially as sea nomads in Thailand as well.\nThe Moken are scattered across an archipelago of some 800 islands on the coast of Myanmar and Thailand. In the days when they lived on boats, Moken stayed on land only during the monsoon season, which started around May. They’d stay on land until the winds shifted, usually around December, and then abandon their temporary homes for the sea. For food, they fished and foraged.\nMany of the older generation were born on boats and sailed regularly amongst the islands.\n“We could move freely without having to worry about the Myanmar government or the Thai government,\" said Tawan Klathale, Hook’s older brother, who was born on a boat. All Moken in Thailand use the surname Klathale, given to the community by one of Thailand’s former queens. \n“Back then,\" said the brother, who is known as Ngui, “there was no clear line to where is Myanmar and where is Thailand.”\nFreedoms began to constrict, and making boats became harder\n\nBut by the time Ngui and Hook were teenagers, they could no longer travel as freely between those islands. Many Moken started settling more permanently in the Surin Islands, off the Thai coast. Some came from Myanmar to Thailand, looking for jobs and safety from pirates. Hook’s family stayed ashore.\nThe parts of the community that stayed in Thailand found that the land they had always visited each season had become a national park by 1981. As a result, they could no longer cut down the large trees they needed to build their boats.\nTo make a kabang, one needs a good strong tree, at least 1 meter wide and 10 meters tall. The trunk needs to be straight and be free of defects. Over the course of months, men of the community would dig out the trunk and carve it into a boat’s hull, while also using fire to make the wood pliable and stretch it out. It was a communal thing, involving up to 10 people.\nNow, it’s difficult to gather enough people. Other men of the village would often be out working during the day. They did not have time to join and work together on a boat.\nNgui and other members of an informal group called Moken Pa Ti’ao, concerned they were losing the knowledge of boat-building, said they approached the park now and then across the years get a tree to make the boat. They were refused years ago by the chief of Mu Ko Surin National Park. The group hasn’t asked since.\nThe park allows them to cut down only small trees, said Ngui, who is also assistant to the village chief in Surin Island. “The restrictions has been like this as far as we can remember.”\nToday, the village in Surin only has one kabang, built by Tat and used mostly to ferry tourists and take children out on day trips. Hook, who lives on the mainland in Thailand, also has a kabang built with the funding of a private donor from Norway after a filmmaker made a documentary about his journey to make one such boat in 2014. But his kabang is built with planks of wood, rather than a single hollowed out tree. \nThey are among the few keen to remember the boats and other traditions. Tat says he has made sure to pass down what he knew to his children, from songs to boat building. \n“If my generation is gone, there would be just very few people left who know how to do these things,” Tat said.\nLearning about the ocean remains a priority\nTogether, Tat and Wilasinee Klathale, a teacher at the school on the island, also try to take village children out on the boats to teach them about the ocean as well as about music and dance.\n“It’s not in the curriculum, but I added them myself, because I could see that these things are going to be lost,” Wilasinee said.\nToday, young Moken are more worried about their livelihoods and finding jobs than how to build a boat. Most only make money during Thailand’s peak tourist season when the national park is open to tourists, from November to April, and have to live on that money for the rest of the year.\nBoyen Klathale, a young Moken man, said it’s difficult to find a job. On Surin, the opportunities are either with the national park or operating boats to take tourists out. Though it’s peak season, he wasn’t able to find a job this year, and he didn’t want to leave behind his family to find work on the mainland.\nThe Moken have asked for more fishing rights in the past, but were denied a further quota beyond the subsistence amount they’re allowed from the park. Ngui, the village chief’s assistant, said he hopes the Moken can sell the souvenirs they make to tourists all year around with help from the government.\nThe future holds some hope. In 2024, the Surin Islands National Park appointed a new chief, Kriengkrai Pohcharoen. In a shift, he said he was open to collaborating with the Moken on a kabang — as long as it was a tree that fell over on its own.\n“I think about how to improve their quality of life, and how they can sustainably live in nature,” he said. “I want them to have a good quality of life.”\nThe Moken are realistic about their permanent switch to land. These days, most prefer it. But some still remember the old ways — and an aquamarine bay filled with handmade kabangs.\n“The world is changing and that’s the way it is, if you ask me,” Ngui said. “I think everything is bound to be lost at some point, but I just want it to stay as long as possible.\"\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Will Howard threw two touchdown passes to freshman Jeremiah Smith and Ohio State routed Tennessee 42-17 on Saturday night in a first-round College Football Playoff game, setting up a New Year's Day rematch with No. 1 Oregon at the Rose Bowl.\nQuinshon Judkins and TreVeyon Henderson rushed for two touchdowns apiece as the Buckeyes (11-2) gave their fans an early Christmas present that should quiet some of the outcry following the devastating fourth straight loss to Michigan three weeks ago.\n“You could tell from the jump that they had a look in their eyes that they were going to win this game,” Ohio State coach Ryan Day said.\nHoward finished 24 for 29 for 311 yards, his second 300-yard game of the season. Smith had six catches for 103 yards, the sixth freshman to have over 100 receiving yards in a CFP game. Henderson had 10 carries for 80 yards.\n“We really put together a full, all-out performance, and I think that’s what we needed to do and what we needed to show,” Howard said.\nEighth-seeded Ohio State scored on its first three drives while forcing three straight Tennessee punts. The ninth-seeded Vols (10-3) finally got on the board with a second-quarter field goal and touchdown but couldn't generate anything in the second half until getting a meaningless touchdown late in the game. \n″We didn’t play the way we needed to, we didn’t play well enough, and we didn’t coach well enough,\" Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said.\n“They made some plays — that’s going to happen against a good team, but what we didn’t do is to come back and find a way to get back on the right side of it, and that’s offensively and defensively.\"\nThe 473 yards gained by Ohio State was the most surrendered by the Tennessee defense all season.\nThe game-time temperature was 25 degrees and dropping in the first college football game played in December in 102-year-old Ohio Stadium. \nTakeaways\n\nTennessee: Star running back Dylan Sampson was hampered by a hamstring injury and had just two carries for 6 yards. Receivers Squirrel White and Dont'e Thorton Jr. also were banged up. limiting the Vols' offense. \nOhio State: The Buckeyes did what they didn't do against Michigan: get the ball on the boundary, throw deep to their most explosive players while establishing a run game.\n“We called this game more aggressively,” Day said. “There’s no question about that.”\nDefense cranks it up\nThe Buckeyes’ defense is statistically the best in the nation and certainly looked like it against Tennessee. The front dogged quarterback Nico Iamaleava and sacked him four times, twice by JT Tuimoloau. The Vols finished with 256 yards, but a big chunk of that came late when the game was already out of reach. They managed just 3.7 yards per play.\nIamaleava finished just 14 for 31 for 104 yards, his lowest total of the season. He rushed a career-high 20 times for 47 yards.\n“I got after them at half time and challenged them, because I knew the way the game was going, as long as we did our job everything was going to turn out all right,” Ohio State defensive coordinator Jim Knowles said. “So, I thought we came out strong in the second half.”\nTennessee turns out\nThere was a large mix of Tennessee orange in the Ohio Stadium crowd of over 104,000, by far biggest fan turnout by an Ohio State opponent in recent memory. Vols fans certainly seemed to get their hands on more than the 3,500 tickets allotted to the school by the NCAA.\nUp next\nThe Buckeyes advance to a second-round game against Oregon in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 1. They lost to the Ducks 32-31 on Oct. 12.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "subhead": "Officials say four women and a 9-year-old boy were killed when a man drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg",
      "body": "\n\nMAGDEBURG, Germany (AP) — Four women and a 9-year-old boy were killed and 200 people were injured when a man drove into a Christmas market teeming with holiday shoppers in the German city of Magdeburg — an attack that has left Germans mourning the victims and with a shaken sense of security.\nHow did the attack unfold? \nAt first, Thi Linh Chi Nguyen thought the loud bangs were fireworks. The 34-year-old manicurist from Vietnam, whose salon is near the Christmas market, was on the phone during a break when she heard the noise just after 7 p.m. on Friday. Then she saw a car drive through the market at high speed. People screamed and a child was thrown into the air by the car.\nThe woman recalled seeing the car bursting out of the market and turning right onto Ernst-Reuter-Allee street and then coming to a standstill at a tram stop where the suspect was arrested.\nThe Christmas market was surrounded by concrete barriers designed to prevent attacks, but there was a gap left for emergency access, wide enough for a car to speed through.\nThe market area reopened Sunday, and residents walked slowly amid the shuttered food, drink and craft stands. Nearby, people stopped to light candles or leave flowers at a growing makeshift memorial.\nWho are the victims?\nPolice say the dead are four women, aged 45, 52, 67 and 75, and a boy, aged 9. He was named as André Gleissner by fire department officials in the Elm-Asse region west of Magdeburg, where he was a member of the children’s fire brigade.\nAuthorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers (80 miles) west of Berlin, and beyond.\nWho is the suspect in the attack?\nProsecutors said the suspect, a 50-year-old Saudi doctor, is under investigation on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. In a closed-door hearing on Saturday evening, a judge ordered that he be kept in custody pending a possible indictment.\nSeveral German media outlets identified the suspect as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. He has lived in Germany since 2006, practicing medicine in Bernburg, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Magdeburg.\nThe suspect's X account describes him as a former Muslim. It is filled with tweets and retweets focusing on anti-Islam themes and criticism of the religion, while sharing congratulatory notes to Muslims who left the faith. He was critical of German authorities, saying they had failed to do enough to combat the “Islamification of Europe.” He has also voiced support for the far-right and anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. \nWhat was the motive?\nInvestigators are analyzing the suspect's computers, mobile devices and other evidence, trying to understand what motivated him to drive his black BMW into a crowd in the eastern German city. Prosecutors said the motive may have been “dissatisfaction with the treatment of Saudi refugees in Germany.”\nIntelligence agencies say that increasingly they are seeing attackers with a confusing mix of beliefs and motivations. The head of Britain’s domestic intelligence agency MI5, Ken McCallum, said in October that “straightforward labels like ‘Islamist terrorism’ or ‘extreme right-wing’ don’t fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see.”\nThere are unanswered questions about what the authorities knew about the suspect. The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said the agency — Germany's equivalent of the FBI — received a warning from Saudi Arabia in November 2023, but that the information was unspecific.\nMünch said the suspect “published a huge number of posts on the internet,” was in contact with various authorities and “made insults and even threats” — but was not known to be violent.\nGermany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees also acknowledged it had received a warning about the suspect last year.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is facing criticism about security lapses that allowed the attack to happen, and was heckled by some bystanders during a visit to Magdeburg on Saturday. \nA string of attacks\nThe violence shocked all of Germany, prompting several other German towns to cancel their weekend Christmas markets as a precaution, and out of solidarity with Magdeburg’s loss. Berlin kept its markets open but increased the police presence.\nGermany has suffered several extremist attacks in recent years, including a knife attack that killed three people and wounded eight at a festival in the western city of Solingen in August. Friday’s attack came eight years after an Islamic extremist drove a truck into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people and injuring many others.\nThose attacks have led cities to beef up security at Christmas markets and other events.\nThe horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany makes it likely that migration will remain a key issue as Germans head toward an early election on Feb. 23.\nIt is the latest in a string of incidents around the world in which vehicles have been used as weapons by jihadi attackers, far-right extremists and others whose motives were unclear. \n\n",

      "subhead": "Manchester City’s stunning slump has deepened after losing at Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League",
      "body": "\n\nManchester City’s stunning slump deepened after losing to Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday.\nGoals from Jhon Duran and Morgan Rogers at Villa Park consigned the four-time defending champion to a ninth defeat in 12 games in a season that is unravelling. Pep Guardiola’s team has won just once during that run.\n“We don’t have a defense for the results. They are not good,” Guardiola said.\nThird-placed Arsenal closed the gap on league leader Liverpool to three points with a 5-1 win at Crystal Palace, but has played two games more.\nCity dropped to sixth in the standings, nine points below Liverpool, and has played two games more.\n“It’s about what I can do with my people to get the results back and continue,” Guardiola said. “If there is a moment that I cannot overthink, it is right now. Try to be simple, stick to my principles and give certainty to the team.”\nTitle hopes fading\nAfter winning six titles in seven years and an unprecedented four in a row, City’s remarkable fall shows little sign of stopping. Guardiola admitted last week he had not been good enough to turn his team’s form around.\nCity was without a win in any of its last eight away games in all competitions. While it looks unlikely to win a fifth straight title, a place in the top four and Champions League qualification could also be in jeopardy after fourth-placed Nottingham Forest won at Brentford 2-0 to move four points clear of City.\nOnly once under Guardiola has City managed to win the title when losing six times in the league. That was in 2021, when it lost two of its last three games, having already been confirmed as the champion.\nCity lost nine times when Liverpool won the title in 2020, but its sixth defeat didn’t come until February. Guardiola also lost six times in his first season in English soccer in 2016-17 and City finished third.\nThe latest defeat could have been even more emphatic from a dominant Villa, which moved up to fifth.\nDuran scored his sixth goal in as many starts in the 16th minute from Rogers’ assist. Duran had a goal disallowed for offside in the second half and Rogers hit the post before doubling Villa’s lead in the 65th.\nPhil Foden pulled a goal back for City in stoppage time, but it wasn’t enough to spark a late comeback.\n“We have to stay positive, even though it’s difficult, and we have to keep working hard,” City striker Erling Haaland said.\nJesus streak\nIt’s five goals in a week for Gabriel Jesus against Crystal Palace.\nAfter scoring a hat trick in Arsenal’s 3-2 comeback win against Palace in the English League Cup quarterfinals on Wednesday, the Brazil striker hit another two goals when the teams met again on Saturday.\nGoing into Wednesday’s game, Jesus had only scored once for Arsenal since the end of January.\nJesus struck twice in a frantic start at Selhurst Park. He opened the scoring in the sixth, with Ismaila Sarr leveling five minutes later.\nJesus restored Arsenal’s lead in the 14th and was denied back-to-back hat tricks when hitting the post and then having another close range effort saved by Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson.\nKai Havertz, Gabriel Martinelli and Declan Rice also scored for Arsenal. \nForest flying high\nIf City’s demise is a surprise story of the season, so is Forest’s rise.\nAfter battling relegation for much of last term, Forest is in contention to qualify for the Champions League and possibly more.\nFacing a Brentford team that was unbeaten at home, goals from Ola Aina and Anthony Elanga secured another statement win on the road for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, having already won at Anfield and Old Trafford this year.\nIsak treble\nAlexander Isak hit a hat trick in Newcastle’s 4-0 win at Ipswich.\nThe Sweden international, who has 10 goals in his last 11 games, wrapped up his treble inside 54 minutes at Portman Road, including one in the opening minute.

      "body": "\n\nKINSHASA, Congo (AP) — A ferry overloaded with people returning home for Christmas capsized on the Busira River in northeastern Congo, leaving 38 people confirmed dead and over 100 others missing, officials and eyewitnesses said Saturday. Twenty people have been rescued so far. \nThe sinking of the ferry late Friday came less than four days after another boat capsized in the country's northeast, killing 25 people.\nThe ferry was traveling as part of a convoy of other vessels and the passengers were primarily merchants returning home for Christmas, said Joseph Joseph Kangolingoli, the mayor of Ingende, the last town on the river before the site of the accident. \nAccording to Ingende resident Ndolo Kaddy, the ferry contained “more than 400 people because it made two ports, Ingende and Loolo, on the way to Boende, so there is reason to believe there were more deaths.”\nCongolese officials have often warned against overloading boats and vowed to punish those violating safety measures on rivers. However, in remote areas many people cannot afford public transportation on the few available roads.\nAt least 78 people drowned in October when an overloaded boat sank in the country’s east while 80 lost their lives in a similar accident near Kinshasa in June.\nThe latest accident prompted anger at the government for not equipping the convoy with flotation devices.\nNesty Bonina, a member of the local government and a prominent figure in Mbandaka, the capital of the Equateur province where the ferry sank, condemned authorities for not properly handling the recent sinkings.\n“How can a ship navigate at night under the watchful eye of river service agents? And now we’re recording over a hundred deaths,” said Bonina. \nThe capsizing of overloaded boats is becoming increasingly frequent in this central African nation as more people are giving up the few available roads in favor of wooden vessels crumbling under the weight of passengers and their goods for security reasons.\nThe roads are often caught up in the deadly clashes between Congolese security forces and rebels that sometimes block major access routes. \n\n",

      "body": "\n\nMatt Rempe of the New York Rangers has been offered an in-person hearing with the NHL’s Department of Player Safety to discuss his boarding and elbowing of Dallas Stars defenseman Miro Heiskanen.\nThe in-person hearing, which can be held via Zoom as opposed to a phone call, allows senior vice president of player safety George Parros and his department to suspend Rempe for six or more games. The time and date of the hearing is to be determined, the league said Saturday.\nRempe, a 6-foot-8 forward, became a fan favorite last season in his rookie year for fighting some of the toughest veteran big men in a throwback to vintage enforcers who largely have disappeared from hockey. But he also ran afoul of the rules, getting ejected twice and receiving a four-game suspension for one of those situations: an elbow to the head of New Jersey’s Jonas Siegenthaler.\nThat history factors in on the length of the suspension, along with injury and intent on the play that occurred with 13 minutes left in the third period Friday night. Heiskanen returned to skate four more shifts after going through concussion protocol, according to Stars coach Peter DeBoer, who called it a dangerous hit.\nThe game at Dallas was Rempe’s first back in the NHL after being recalled from the minors following the Rangers' trade of winger Kaapo Kakko to Seattle. Rempe spent the summer training to become a better fighter but also worked to become a better all-around player.\nNow 22, Rempe has spent the vast majority of the season with Hartford of the American Hockey League. He played less than six minutes in the 3-1 win against the Stars, after which Rangers coach Peter Laviolette told reporters he thought Rempe “had a big impact on the game.”\n“I’d like to stay away from the 5-minute major, but he’s doing his best to hit bodies and make a difference in the game,” Laviolette said. \"Our guys really rallied around that at the end.”\n___\nAP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nSuchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.\nBalaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.\n“We are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir’s loved ones during this difficult time,” said a statement from OpenAI.\nBalaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said “appeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.” The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.\nHis parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a “happy, smart and brave young man” who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends. \nBalaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.\n“Suchir’s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn’t have succeeded without him,” said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.\n“He had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,” Schulman wrote. “He’d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.”\nBalaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement. \nHe first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.\nHe later told The Associated Press he would “try to testify” in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the “most serious.” Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have “unique and relevant documents” supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement. \nHis records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.\n“It doesn’t feel right to be training on people’s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,” Balaji told the AP in late October. “I don’t think you should be able to do that. I don’t think you are able to do that legally.”\nHe told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.\nBut of the “bag of issues” he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was “actually possible to do something about.”\nHe acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said “they will have to change and it’s a matter of time.”\nHe had not been deposed and it’s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.\nSchulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji’s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.\nSchulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence “was right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.” The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring “some more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,” Schulman said.\nBalaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino. \n—————-\nEDITOR’S NOTE — This story includes discussion of suicide.

      "headline": "Shutdown saga exposes new fault lines for Speaker Johnson and tests his grip on the gavel",
      "subhead": "One of the most turbulent sessions of Congress in the modern era is about to make way for the next one",
      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — One of the most turbulent sessions of Congress in the modern era is about to make way for the next one.\nMidnight passage of the government shutdown package put in sharp focus the political fault lines emerging in Washington, as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., fights for his job and Republicans sweep into control of the House and Senate in the new year.\nIt took bipartisan votes, Republicans and Democrats, to keep government running for a few more months and provide some $100 billion for disaster aid. Working together, the parties showed the House and Senate can still function, at times, to accomplish the basics of governing.\n“After a chaotic few days in the House, it’s good news that the bipartisan approach in the end prevailed,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat. \"It’s a good lesson for next year. Both sides have to work together.”\nBut next year, with big GOP promises to cut taxes and slash spending, while also pumping in new money to fund Trump’s border security and deportation operations, Republicans intend to go it alone.\n“We are set up for a big and important new start in January,” Johnson said. “We can’t wait to get started.”\nFirst, though, Johnson needs to be sure he has a job.\nJohnson's shaky grip on the gravel\nThe first vote of the new House, when lawmakers are sworn in on Jan. 3, is on electing a speaker. That leaves Johnson little time to calm the criticism after facing stark blowback over his management of the government shutdown fight.\nJohnson was never the House Republicans’ top choice for the speaker’s office but he emerged when they couldn’t agree on a replacement once they kicked out the last speaker, Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\nKeeping the gavel is only becoming more difficult. The government shutdown saga exposed the limits of Johnson's influence over his majority, and Trump, when his first two funding plans collapsed. It's unclear if Johnson will have enough support from his ranks.\n“It’s always the big question, right?” said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., among the handful of mainly fiscal conservatives who cast their votes to oust McCarthy. “Ultimately, and let’s be honest, that’s going to be — a large portion of that — will be up to Donald J. Trump.” \nAnd yet, Johnson was able to buy time, convincing Trump he would meet the president-elect’s demands to raise the debt limit in the new year. Johnson has worked hard to stay close to Trump — dashing to Mar-a-Lago and joining him ringside at Madison Square Garden — and the investment shows.\nJohnson insisted Trump was “certainly happy” with the final deal.\n“The Speaker did a good job here, given the circumstances,” posted Trump ally Elon Musk, who has been mentioned as a potential replacement, since the speaker does not need to be a member of Congress.\nJohnson has no votes to spare, having actually lost House seats in the fall election, shrinking his majority. Democrats will oppose him with their own speaker candidate, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n“Clearly, Johnson is not up to the task,” said Trump ally and podcast provocateur Steven Bannon at a conservative conference. \"He doesn’t have what we call the right stuff — that combination of guts and moxie and savvy and toughness.”\nMusk emerges as a power broker on Capitol Hill\nThe world's richest man is fast becoming Capitol Hill's most feared influencer. \nMusk intervened in the government shutdown debate using the enormous power of his social media platform, X, to ravage Johnson's original 1,500-page bipartisan bill, swiftly tearing it down.\nIn post after post, hour after hour, Musk unleashed his criticisms, and sometimes inaccurate claims, sending his army of online followers to figuratively flood the Capitol, warning that if lawmakers voted for it he would take them on with primary elections. His vast wealth and America PAC backed up his threats.\n“Kill the bill,” Musk demanded.\nMusk had his moment, but also launched a new one for himself.\nDemocrat after Democrat, and at least one Republican, turned on Musk, seeing not a benevolent billionaire wading into the political process, but a symbol of extreme U.S. wealth and power run amok.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, decried the health care and other bipartisan provisions stripped from the bill to scale it back as Musk had demanded.\n“The precedent that has been set today in Congress should upset every American,” Sanders said in a statement announcing his refusal to support the final bill. He voted against it.\n“It appears that from now on no major legislation can be passed without the approval of the wealthiest person in this country,” Sanders said. “That’s not democracy, that’s oligarchy.”\nTrump runs the GOP but not the deficit hawks\nOne of the most outspoken conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus is Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who led the charge against Trump’s demand for a debt limit hike as part of the government shutdown package.\nTrump tried to bully and blister Roy into submission. It didn’t work.\n“The very unpopular ‘Congressman’ from Texas, Chip Roy, is getting in the way, as usual,” Trump posted on social media.\nTrump suggested there should be a primary challenge against Roy. “Republican obstructionists have to be done away with,\" he said.\nRoy, though, has his own popular following as a leading deficit hawk. He held his own, ignoring Trump’s attack and admonishing his colleagues not to go along with Trump's demand to boost the debt ceiling and allow more borrowing.\n“You go out and campaign, say you’re going to balance the budget, and then you come in here,” he shouted, choking up at times during the floor debate. “It’s embarrassing.”\nIn the end, 38 House Republicans including Roy sided with Democrats and tanked Trump’s debt ceiling increase.\nThe next debt limit fight is coming soon\nThe failure of Trump's preferred spending bill, with the debt limit increase, signals problems ahead.\nRepublicans will have to raise the debt ceiling in the first half of the year — likely by early summer according to some estimates — and there will be a large price to pay. It is leverage in any policy talks.\nAs part of the deal Johnson made to pass the temporary government funding package, he struck a “gentlemen's agreement” behind closed doors with his fellow Republicans ahead of Friday's vote.\nThe House Republicans agreed to slash some $2.5 trillion from federal spending over the next decade as part of the emerging tax cut bill, which is an enormous sum in federal budgeting, in exchange for boosting the debt limit, as will need to happen to avoid a federal default.\nBurchett, for one, had no interest in any such deals.\n“I said, 'This ain’t no place for gentlemen,'” he said. “That's when I yelled out, ‘You’re losing me’.”\nTrump may have lost the deficit hawks on the vote, but not his own political sway on Capitol Hill.\n“He’s still strong,” Burchett said. “People still love him back home. And that’s all that really matters.”\n___ Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report.\n\n",

According to Peskov, the talks would focus on “the international situation” and Russian natural gas deliveries. \nVisits and phone calls from European leaders to Putin have been rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine, although Hungary’s PM Viktor Orban visited Russia in July. Orban’s visit drew condemnation from Kyiv and European leaders\n\n",

      "subhead": "Approximately 1 million taxpayers will automatically receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS in the coming weeks",
      "body": "\n\nApproximately 1 million taxpayers will automatically receive special payments of up to $1,400 from the IRS in the coming weeks. The money will be directly deposited into eligible people's bank accounts or sent in the mail by a paper check. \nThe IRS said it's distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. People who missed one of the COVID stimulus payments or had received less than the full amount were able to claim the credit. But the IRS on Friday said it discovered many eligible taxpayers hadn't done so.\n“Looking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.\nHere's more about the unexpected cash this group of taxpayers will soon receive:\nWhat's the likelihood I'll receive a check? \nSorry, it's probably pretty low. The IRS said most taxpayers eligible for the federal stimulus payments, formally known as Economic Impact Payments, have already received them.\nThe special payments announced by the IRS are being sent to those taxpayers who filed a 2021 tax return but left the data field for the Recovery Rebate Credit blank or they filled it out as $0 when they were actually eligible for the credit.\nHow will this work?\nEligible taxpayers don't have to take any action. The payments will go out automatically this month and should arrive by direct deposit or check by late January 2025. They'll be sent to the bank account listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or to the address IRS has on file. \nPayments will vary but the maximum amount will be $1,400 per individual. The IRS has posted information online about eligibility and how the payment was calculated.\nIRS plans to send separate letters to eligible taxpayers notifying them of the special payment.\nWhat if I haven't filed my 2021 tax return yet?\nYou still might be able to receive the money. However, taxpayers need to file a tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit by the April 15, 2025 deadline, even if any income from a job, business or other source was minimal or nonexistent, according to IRS.\nHow many rounds of COVID stimulus payments were there? \nThere were three rounds of payments to households impacted by the pandemic, totaling $814 billion. IRS based the amounts that taxpayers received on their income, tax filing status and number of children or qualifying dependents. \nIn March 2020, eligible individuals received up to $1,200 per income tax filer and $500 per child under the CARES Act. In December 2020, eligible individuals received up to $600 per income tax filer and $600 per child under the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In March 2021, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 per income tax filer and $1,400 per child under the American Rescue Plan Act.\n\n",

      "subhead": "It is just about time to say goodbye, once and for all, to the amateur athlete in college sports",
      "body": "\n\nWhen the page turns on 2024, it will be time to say goodbye, once and for all, to the amateur athlete in college sports.\nIn theory, the concept held on stubbornly via the quaint and now all-but-dead notion that student-athletes played only for pride, a scholarship and some meal money.\nIn practice, the amateurs have been disappearing for years, washed away by the steady millions, now billions, that have flowed into college athletics, mostly through football and basketball both through legitimate and illicit means.\nIn the coming year, the last vestiges of amateur college sports are expected to officially sputter out — the final step of a journey that has felt inevitable since 2021. That's when the Supreme Court laid the foundation for paying college players in exchange for promotions — on social media, TV, video games, you name it — featuring their name, image or likeness (NIL).\nThe changes have come in spasms so far, not always well thought out, not always fair and not regulated by any single entity like the NCAA or federal government, but rather by a collection of state laws, along with rules at individual schools and the leagues in which they play.\nBut on April 7, the day final approval is expected for the landmark, $2.8 billion lawsuit settlement that lays the foundation for players to receive money directly from their schools, what was once considered anathema to the entire concept of college sports will become the norm.\nDavid Schnase, the NCAA’s vice president for academic and membership affairs, acknowledges that maintaining the unique essence of college sports is a challenge in the shifting landscape.\n“You can use the word ‘pro,’ you can use the word ‘amateur,’ you can attach whatever moniker you want to it, but those are just labels,” Schnase said. “It’s much less about labels and more about experiences and circumstances. Circumstances are different today than they were last year and they are likely going to be different in the foreseeable future.”\nDo athletes get rich off these new deals?\nFew would argue that college athletes should get something back for the billions they help produce in TV and ticket revenue, merchandise sales and the like.\nBut is everyone going to cash in? Are college players really getting rich?\nRecent headlines suggest top quarterback recruit Bryce Underwood was lured to Michigan thanks to funding from billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and that a top basketball recruit, A.J. Dybantsa, is heading to BYU — not a hoops powerhouse — for the reported price of $7 million.\nFor every Underwood or Dybantsa, though, there are even more Matthew Slukas and Beau Pribulas.\nSluka's agent says his son agreed to play quarterback at UNLV after a promise of receiving $100,000 and quit three games into the season after the checks never came.\nPribula was the backup quarterback at Penn State who abruptly entered the transfer portal earlier this month, choosing the college version of free agency over a chance to play with the Nittany Lions in the College Football Playoff. He's not the only one hitting the portal in hopes of getting rich before new regulations related to the NCAA settlement take effect.\n“We’ve got problems in college football,” Penn State coach James Franklin said.\nThe settlement will overhaul the current system. Currently, players receive money via third-party collectives that are booster-funded groups affiliated with individual schools. Coming up fast: the schools paying the athletes directly — the term often used here is “revenue sharing” — with collectives still an option, but not the only one.\n“It's going to be more transparent,” said Jeff Kessler, the plaintiffs' attorney and antitrust veteran who helped shape the settlement. “If anything, having the schools handling all the payments is only going to improve the system.”\nThe NCAA has started collecting data about NIL payments, which date to July 2021. Its first set of numbers, which includes data from more than 140 schools across more than 40 sports in 2024, show a bracing disconnect between have and have-nots.\nFor instance, average earnings for football and men's and women's basketball players is nearly $38,000. But the median earning — the middle number among all the data points on the list — is only $1,328, a sign of how much the biggest contracts skew the average.\nWomen make vastly less than men\nThe statistics also show a vast difference in earnings between men and women, an issue that could impact schools' ability to comply with Title IX. That 1972 law requires schools to provide equal athletic scholarships and financial aid but not necessarily that they spend the same dollar amount on men and women. Heading into 2025, there is no clarity on how this issue will play out.\nRegardless, the numbers are jarring. The NCAA data set shows the average earnings for women in 16 sports was $8,624, compared with $33,321 for men in 11 sports. Men,'s basketball players averaged $56,000 compared with $11,500 for women.\nPaying players could cost some and benefit others\nThe biggest losers from this move toward a professional model could be all the swimmers and wrestlers and field hockey players — the athletes in the so-called non-revenue sports whose programs also happen to serve as the backbone of the U.S. Olympic team.\nOnly a tiny percentage of those athletes are getting rich, and now that universities have to use revenue to pay the most sought-after players in their athletic programs, there could be cuts to the smaller sports.\nAlso, someone's going to have backfill the revenue that will now go to the players. Well-heeled donors like Ellison are not around for every school, nor have private equity firms started sending money.\nThe average fan will have to pony up, and the last six months have seen dozens if not hundreds of athletic directors begging alumni for money and warning them of changes ahead. Already there are schools placing surcharges on tickets or concessions.\nHow will fans respond to a more transactional model of college sports?\n“I don't know that fans have this really great love for the idea of 100% pure amateurism,” said Nels Popp, a University of North Carolina sports business professor. “I think what they care about is the colors and the logos and the brand. I don't know that it matters to them if the players are making a little bit of money or a lot of money. They've been making money for the last couple years, and I don't know that that's making fans really back off.”\nOlympics got rid of ‘amateurs’ and turned into a multibillion-dollar industry\nThe last time amateurism came under such assault was in the 1980s, when the Olympics unwound the final remnants of pretending the vast majority of their athletes were anything other than full-time professionals.\nThe transformation was tinged with a note of honesty: The people putting on the show should reap some benefits from it. Even 40 years later, there's an good argument they remain underpaid.\nThe contours of the same debate are shaping up in college sports.\nAthletes are pushing for a players’ association that would add more transparency to a business that, even with the changes coming, is still largely dictated by the schools.\nThe NCAA, while acceding to the need to pay the players, wants nothing to do with turning them into actual employees of the schools they play for. It's an expensive prospect that is winding its way through the legal system via lawsuits and labor hearings that many in college sports are desperate to avoid for fear it will push the entire industry off the financial cliff.\nAmong the few things everyone agrees on is that things aren't going back to a time when athletes pretended to play for pride while the money moved under tables and through shadows. And that this, in fact, could only be the start, not the end, of the transformation of college sports.\n“At some point, I think people might have to understand that maybe college athletes don't go to college anymore,” Popp said. “Or maybe they don't go to class during the season. There could be more radical changes, and as long as they're wearing the right logo and the right colors, I'm not sure that fans really care.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "subhead": "Cyclone Chido not only ravaged Mayotte’s fragile infrastructure but also laid bare deep-seated tensions between the island’s residents and its large migrant population",
      "body": "\n\nMAMOUDZOU, Mayotte (AP) — When Cyclone Chido ravaged Mayotte’s fragile infrastructure, it also exposed deep-seated tensions between the island’s residents and its large migrant population. \nThousands of people who have entered the island illegally bore the brunt of the storm that tore through the Indian Ocean archipelago — France's poorest territory. Authorities in Mayotte said many migrants avoided emergency shelters out of fear of deportation, leaving themselves and the precarious shantytowns they inhabit even more vulnerable to the devastation. \nMeanwhile, anger simmered among residents who accused the government of diverting the island’s already scarce resources to migrants at their expense.\n“We are the legitimate population of this island,” said Amada Salime. Standing in the rubble of his home on Saturday, he added, “If there is help from the government — water or something to eat or money to make houses — Mahorais people will not have it. Immigrants are more numerous than us, and we will be left behind.”\nMayotte, a French department located between Madagascar and mainland Africa, has a population of 320,000. French authorities have estimated another 100,000 migrants also live there, most of whom have arrived from the nearby Comoros Islands, just 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.\nThe island’s fragile public services, designed for a much smaller population, are buckling under the strain. According to the French statistics agency INSEE, around three-quarters of Mayotte’s population live in poverty, with a median annual disposable income just one-eighth that of the Paris metropolitan area.\n“The problems of Mayotte cannot be solved without addressing illegal immigration,” French President Emmanuel Macron said during his testy visit this week, acknowledging the challenges posed by the island’s rapid population growth. “Despite the state’s investments, migratory pressure has made everything explode,” he added.\nPeople living in Mayotte for decades worry about a crackdown \nThe cyclone further exacerbated the island’s issues after destroying homes, schools and infrastructure. Though the official death toll remains 35, authorities say that any estimates are likely major undercounts, with hundreds feared dead. \nThe migrants’ shantytowns, known as “bangas,” have long been an issue in Mayotte. “Can we solve the issue of shantytowns today? The answer is no. We will address it during the stabilization and rebuilding phase,” Macron said.\nFor many migrants, like Nazca Antoiy, a Comorian who has lived in Mayotte for a decade, the cyclone has heightened fears of displacement.\n“I heard that people were told not to reconstruct new houses. So we need to worry about that,” she said, reflecting a widespread concern that authorities may use the disaster to expedite demolitions of informal settlements.\nSuch concerns are not unfounded. Last year, France launched Operation Wuambushu, a controversial campaign to demolish shantytowns and deport migrants who entered illegally. Macron hinted that similar policies could resume but stressed reconstruction efforts would take precedence.\nThe storm has left many residents struggling to meet basic needs.\nA hotspot for migrants \n“I can’t take it anymore. Just to have water is complicated,” said Fatima, a 46-year-old mother of five whose family has been without clean water since the storm ravaged Mayotte last weekend. Fatima, who only gave her first name because her family is known locally, also said she felt the island could not support the current population, let alone more.\nMost migrants have family links in Mayotte and speak the same language. They seek a better life on the island rather than aiming to reach the European continent.\nMayotte’s geopolitical position has long made it a hotspot for migration. While the island voted to remain French in referendums held in 1974 and 1976, neighboring Comoros has never recognized its sovereignty and continues to claim the archipelago as its own. This unresolved dispute has fueled waves of migration, with thousands risking perilous sea crossings each year.\nOutgoing French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau recently reignited the debate, describing the situation in Mayotte as a “war,” earlier this week. Retailleau proposed stricter measures, including using drones and naval patrols to block further arrivals. “We must be much tougher on the Comoros,” he said, accusing the neighboring government of allowing migrants to leave its shores unchecked.\nRetailleau’s calls to “change the rules” include proposals to restrict birthright citizenship in Mayotte, a policy already tightened in 2018 to require proof that at least one parent had been a legal resident for more than three months. Critics argue that these measures only deepen Mayotte’s divisions without addressing the root causes of migration.\nA 2023 parliamentary report cited in French media warned that the island was a “ticking time bomb,” while suggesting redistributing part of Mayotte’s migrant population to mainland France — a proposal unlikely to gain widespread support.\n___\nAdamson reported from Paris.\n\n",

      "subhead": "Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children",
      "body": "\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children. Families are struggling during the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\nAt least 35 children were killed in southwestern Oyo state on Wednesday. And on Saturday, 22 people died in southeastern Anambra state while 10 died in the capital, Abuja, where more than 1,000 people had gathered at a church to receive clothes and food.\nHere's why people in Africa's most populous country are risking their lives for holiday donations.\nInflation at a 28-year high\n“There is hunger in this Nigeria. Every Nigerian needs food,” one woman, in tears, told the local Arise television after the stampede in Abuja.\nThe economic crisis is blamed on the government’s policies to save money and attract investors, which have contributed to pushing the inflation rate to a 28-year high of 34.6%. Meanwhile the naira currency languishes at record lows against the dollar.\nAt least 63% of Nigeria's more than 210 million people population is poor, according to the government's statistics office. The government has struggled to create jobs. And when people gather to protest hardship, security forces are quick to clamp down. In August, more than 20 people were shot dead by security forces during nationwide protests.\n“The average Nigerian has seen food go out of their reach,” said Cheta Nwanze, managing partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm. In 2022, the firm found that about 97% of Nigerians spend up to 63% of their income on food, but that share must have grown since then, he said.\nSome of those who died in Abuja had waited overnight outside the church in cold weather for the chance to enter early, according to Loveth Inyang, a witness who rescued a baby from the crush.\nSecurity is costly, too\nDeadly stampedes are not new in Nigeria and are often caused by lack of adherence to public safety measures. But analysts say people's desperation to survive is making crowd control more difficult.\nAccounts from witnesses and police in Abuja and Anambra showed that the stampedes occurred before the events started as people tried to secure prime positions.\nIn Abuja, the church was forced to cancel the event, leaving bags of rice and clothing items inside.\nOrganizers of such charity events often do not consider security a priority, said Ademola Adetuberu, who runs the Abuja-based Barricade Executive Protection security firm.\nMeanwhile, the number of events is increasing as philanthropists and organizations try to meet the growing demand for food.\n“If organizers of such events brainstorm more, get professionals to advise them and have a budget for security, this can be prevented,” Adetuberu said.\nHow authorities are responding\nNigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has asked authorities to no longer tolerate “operational lapses” by organizers of such events, while police have made it mandatory for organizers to get prior permission before hosting them.\nBut such commitments are not new and usually difficult to enforce, analysts said.\n“People’s incomes have been squeezed through the entire year. When they hear somewhere that food is being distributed, their natural instinct is to go,\" Nwanze said. “Add this to our notoriously poor queue culture and you have the perfect storm that will lead to such a stampede.”\n\n",

      "subhead": "The average final score over the first week of the College Football Playoffs: Winners 36, Losers 17",
      "body": "\n\nFor those who dozed through it, or flipped to more compelling fare in the NFL, here's a brief recap of the rollout of the much-anticipated College Football Playoff.\nAverage final score: Winners 36, Losers 17.\nIn four games, not a single one was closer than a 10-point margin, and even that one felt worse.\nThis bold, new experiment was supposed to bring more programs from more parts of the country into the loop of a largely regional sport that had been dominated by about a half-dozen teams for the last decade.\nInstead, it will take another 10 days to find out if “more” really means more — or if more just means a few weeks of what we just saw before arriving at what we had before — a group of four contenders battling it out for a title that only they had any realistic chance to win.\nOne part that did feel like a success was that the stands were full in all four stadiums — at Texas, Notre Dame, Penn State and Ohio State.\n“I think college football got this one right,” Texas coach Steve Sarkisian said after the Longhorns beat Clemson 38-24 in front of a packed house in what turned out to be the weekend's most compelling game. “As much as we critique some of the things that are happening in our game right now, this idea of a home playoff game with this 12-team format, this was pretty special.”\nThe TV ratings will paint a fuller picture, especially of the decision to run directly against two NFL games, both of which came down to the fourth quarter.\nCould the quarterfinals bring more of the same?\nThe quarterfinals come over the New Year's holiday, where we'll get more clarity not only about who might win the title, but whether the CFP as it is structured is as good as it can be. The matchups (and issues involved in all of them):\nFiesta Bowl, Dec. 31, No. 6 Penn State vs. No. 3 Boise State: The rules called for the four highest-ranked conference champions to receive first-round byes, and so you get this. Penn State is the worse seed but is a 10 1/2-point favorite over the Mountain West Conference champions. Boise State has the nation's leading rusher in Ashton Jeanty. Penn State is probably bigger and faster at every other position.\nPeach Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 5 Texas vs. No. 4 Arizona State: See above for thoughts about byes, potential mismatches and pairings that might have made more sense had they come earlier. Texas is a 13 1/2-point favorite. But, the Sun Devils of the Big 12 are the closest thing this tournament has to a Cinderella — in win-or-you're-done territory since Nov. 2, and with a pair of eminently entertaining players in quarterback Sam Leavitt and running back Cam Skattebo.\nRose Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 8 Ohio State vs. No. 1 Oregon: Had the rule-makers chosen to reseed the bracket after the first round to give Oregon a game against the highest-seeded team left, this would have been the matchup anyway. But do we really want a rematch of possibly the best game in college football this season — Oregon's 32-31 win over Ohio State in October — in the quarterfinals?\nSugar Bowl, Jan. 1, No. 7 Notre Dame at No. 2 Georgia: Reports are that Bulldogs quarterback Carson Beck might be done for the season after hurting his elbow in the SEC title game. The selection committee was supposed to consider injuries in its rankings, but probably didn't have enough information to make an informed decision at the time. Long ago, in a galaxy far away, Georgia beat Notre Dame in the 1981 Sugar Bowl to capture its second national title.\nThe transfer portal chips away at rosters\nThe transfer portal will (thankfully?) close Dec. 28, meaning the steady trickle of departures from teams with title hopes will not infiltrate the headlines as we head into football's elite eight.\nBut this entire setup is awkward. Arizona State lost 12 players to the portal after it opened on Dec. 9. Tennessee lost 11. The highest-profile departure was Penn State backup quarterback Beau Pribula. Whether these players would've been on the field much (they wouldn't, which is probably why some left) almost seems beside the point.\nFor decades, playing to win a championship was thought to be the north star for any elite athlete. Or so we thought. There is a lot of money available, and it's also not hard to blame a player for trying to max out his earning potential in the new world of college football endorsements.\n“I think everybody that follows the sport understands that it’s a unique time of year,” Tennessee coach Josh Heupel said. “I’m not in charge of that. Do I think they need to find a way to go through all the processes that they have right now, or things that are in the game but find a better calendar for it? Yeah, I think that would be best for the game for sure.”\nDeion not in the playoffs but his stars will be playing\nThere are another 28 bowl games remaining that will have no implication on the national title. Maybe the best one is Dec. 28 when Heisman winner Travis Hunter and Colorado face BYU in the Alamo Bowl.\nThere's nothing particularly big on the line here, but there is a message being sent.\nColorado has two first-round draft picks on the roster in Hunter and the coach's son, quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Normally, they wouldn't find themselves anywhere near this game, for fear an injury could derail their pro prospects.\nBut they will play. Coach Deion Sanders has shouldered his share of criticism for being the face of a largely transactional, money-driven NIL era. But his ability to steer his best two players to find meaning in a game with no stakes is as old-school as it gets, and the exact opposite of the transfer portal mess.\n“It’s not just a bowl game where we’re going to go be merry and have a Merry Christmas and exchange gifts and do all of that,” the coach explained. “No, we want to go there and play Buff football.\"\n——\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "headline": "What is a biblically accurate angel? And do you need one to top your Christmas tree?",
      "subhead": "About 7 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe in angels, but what, exactly, is an angel",
      "body": "\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — It was during the pandemic when the Rev. Kira Austin-Young and her puppet-maker husband, Michael Schupbach, were going a little stir-crazy that they came up with the idea. Instead of a star or some stylized humanoid angel to top their Christmas tree, why not create a biblically accurate angel? \nThe result was a pink, blue and gold-feathered creature with six wings and dozens of eyes that went a little bit viral.\n“I think in, particularly, the times of the world that we’re in, where things seem kind of scary and weird, having a scary and weird angel sort of speaks to people,” she said. \nThere are a number of different kinds of angels that show up in the Bible, said Austin-Young, associate rector of the Episcopal Church of St. Mary the Virgin in San Francisco. For the most part, we don't get a lot of description of them, but both Revelations at the end of the Bible and some of the books of the prophets in the Old Testament describe strange creatures around the throne of God. \n“Some of them have six wings with eyes covering the wings,\" she said. Others have multiple animal heads. “I think one of the delightful things about the Bible and the Scripture is just kind of how bizarre it can be and just how kind of out there it can be.”\nAbout 7 in 10 U.S. adults say they believe in angels, according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research conducted last year. Still, there's no agreement about what they look like or even exactly what they are. \nSocial media is full of various interpretations of “biblically accurate angels” imagined not just in tree toppers but also drawings, tattoos, even makeup tutorials. The many-eyed creatures reject traditional portrayals of angels in Western art, where they often look like humans with wings, usually white and often blonde or very fair.\nEsther Hamori, a professor of Hebrew Bible at Union Theological Seminary, makes a distinction between angels and other “supernatural species” in the Bible like seraphim and cherubim, but she said she loves the biblically accurate angel trend, even if it conflates them.\n“It shows that people are thinking about ways in which the Bible contains far stranger things than what’s often taught,\" the author of “God’s Monsters: Vengeful Spirits, Deadly Angels, Hybrid Creatures, and Divine Hitmen of the Bible\" wrote in an email. \n“The biblical heavens are filled with weird, frightening figures. In the Bible, God has an entourage of monsters.”\nOne of Austin-Young's favorite portrayals of the annunciation — a favorite theme of Christian art depicting the archangel Gabriel's appearance to Mary to announce that she is going to bear the son of God — is by Henry Ossawa Tanner. It conceives of Gabriel as a vaguely humanoid shaft of light.\n“It kind of makes you rethink, ‘What would that be like to be approached by an angel?’\" she said. \"If it’s somebody you don’t know, or if it’s a strange creature, or if it’s just this kind of manifestation of God’s message to you. ... That could be anything.”\n___\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

      "subhead": "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk’s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta’s Threads and its algorithms",
      "body": "\n\nBluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms. \nThe platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory — with a user base that has more than doubled since October — could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms. \nBut with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.\nThe skyrocketing user base — now surpassing 25 million — is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.\nBesides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil. \n“They got this spike in attention, they’ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,” said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One’s Council for Responsible Social Media. “But they don’t have the cash flow, they don’t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.”\nTo manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as “starter packs” that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature. \nCompared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a “quite different” value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience. \n“The first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,” Bluesky said on its blog in March. “Our online experience doesn’t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.” \nBecause of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players. \n“People had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,” Wardle said. “But the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it’s in other people’s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.” \nLittle data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.\nLion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident — a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.\n“I noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper ‘Die Ziet,’” he said in an email to The Associated Press. “I have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk’s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.”\nCassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.\nThere are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.\nCopycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he’d initially detected — a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.\nBluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what’s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party “Labelers” that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context. \nThe company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.\nEven as its challenges aren’t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a “crossroads,” said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter’s civic integrity team.\n“Whether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,” Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.\nThat said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be. \nPolitical polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X. \n“Bluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,” Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're “trying to keep everybody happy” are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't — see Meta's platforms — the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

      "body": "\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — JuJu Watkins and Paige Bueckers both showed out in a primetime matchup between two of the brightest stars in women's basketball.\nWatkins got the best of the rematch from last season's Elite Eight that UConn won, helping No. 7 USC to a 72-70 victory over the fourth-ranked Huskies on Saturday night in front of a sold out crowd of 15,684 fans.\nWatkins said it was probably the biggest crowd she’s played in front of so far.\n“I think it's a testament to when you give women's basketball a platform, we're going to perform,” said Watkins, who scored 25 points. \"I think tonight was an excellent game. ... It was beautiful to be a part of and I can imagine watching it, super exciting.”\nThe regular season win was big, but Watkins said it didn't erase the sting of last season's loss that ended the Trojans' season.\n“It was an Elite Eight game, clearly it weighs differently,” the sophomore sensation said. “Last year it meant a little bit more. Avenging that was important.”\nThe pair of All-Americans guarded each other for much of the game. On one possession in the third quarter, Watkins blocked Bueckers shot and then took the ball down to the other end and dribbled between her legs before scoring.\nHaving the two stars matched up was great theater.\n“Yeah definitely playing against great players you embrace the matchup and have fun in the moment,\" said Bueckers, who finished with 22 points. \"Both teams were trying to win. Matchups like these are why we play basketball.”\nBueckers later added that it was huge to have marquee matchups for the sport.\n“It’s very important for the game to continue to grow and have these types of matchups,” Bueckers said. “For people to not shy away from it and to embrace it and schedule more opponents like these.”\nGeno Auriemma has seen a lot of big games and stars over his 40 years at UConn. There was something special about Saturday night's game.\n“Happy that we can put two players like that on the floor that the whole country is familiar with and wants to see play well,” Auriemma said. “Both have their unique styles of playing.”\n“I was driving in today to the game and it brought back to me the very first game we played here in ‘86 or ’87, I don’t even know. ... I don’t think there were 100 people in the building. To drive up here and know there would be 16,000 people here plus the game on national television doesn’t seem like we’re talking about the same universe but this is what happened and where we are today. I'm proud to be a part of it.”\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

      "subhead": "Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence",
      "body": "\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. The seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately — and frequently capped by a dome.\nVisitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design.\nThe 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features.\nThey are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls.\nAnd every week, in a throwback to a time before wristwatches and cellphones, clock winders roam the halls — ensuring the century-plus-old timekeepers keep ticking.\nOn a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done — going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one.\nGill is a former art student who works for Johnson & Griffiths Studio, a Harrisburg firm that just received a five-year, $526,000 winding and maintenance contract renewal from the Capitol Preservation Committee.\nShe's also a lifelong clock lover who looks forward to the semiannual transitions between daylight saving time and Eastern Standard Time.\nWhy?\n“My dad was a clock collector growing up,” Gill said. “And every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad.”\nPennsylvania's Capitol was crafted by architect Joseph M. Huston, who won its design competition in 1901 with a vision for a temple of democracy — a palace of art that would be as fancy as what could then be found in Europe. \nAmong countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State.\n“The clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,” said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. “The mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.”\nEvery so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound.\nHuston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.\nWhile the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nBEIRUT (AP) — A prominent Lebanese politician held talks on Sunday with the insurgent who led the overthrow of Syria's President Bashar Assad, with both expressing hope for a new era in relations between their countries.\nDruze leader Walid Jumblatt is the most prominent Lebanese politician to visit Syria since the Assad family’s 54-year rule ended two weeks ago. Jumblatt was a longtime critic of Syria's involvement in Lebanon and blamed Assad's father, former leader Hafez Assad, for the assassination of his own father.\nHe held talks with Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the Sunni Islamist rebels who swept into Damascus earlier this month and forced the younger Assad from power.\nNow wearing a suit and tie, al-Sharaa has been meeting with diplomats and others from around the region and beyond as Assad's fall reshapes alliances and gives many long-stifled Syrians hope after more than 13 years of civil war and international sanctions.\n“We salute the Syrian people for their great victories and we salute you for your battle that you waged to get rid of oppression and tyranny that lasted over 50 years,” said Jumblatt, a key figure in Lebanon’s Druze minority.\nHe expressed hope that Lebanese-Syrian relations “will return to normal.”\nJumblatt's father, Kamal, was killed in 1977 in an ambush near a Syrian roadblock during Syria's military intervention in Lebanon's civil war.\n“Syria was a source of concern and disturbance, and its interference in Lebanese affairs was negative,” al-Sharaa said, referring to the Assad government. “Syria will no longer be a case of negative interference in Lebanon,\" he added.\nAl-Sharaa also repeated longstanding allegations that Assad's government was behind the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, which was followed by other killings of prominent Lebanese critics of Assad.\nLast year, the United Nations closed an international tribunal investigating that assassination after it convicted three members of Lebanon's Hezbollah — an ally of Assad — in absentia. Hezbollah denied involvement in the bombing that killed Hariri and 21 others.\n“We hope that all those who committed crimes against the Lebanese will be held accountable, and that fair trials will be held for those who committed crimes against the Syrian people,” Jumblatt said.\nIran's leader predicts trouble for new Syrian rulers\nSeparately, Iran's supreme leader asserted that young Syrians will resist the new government emerging after Assad's ouster, as he again accused the United States and Israel of sowing chaos in the country.\nIran provided crucial support to Assad throughout Syria's civil war, which erupted after he launched a violent crackdown on a popular uprising. Syria had long served as a key conduit for Iranian aid to Hezbollah.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address on Sunday that the “young Syrian has nothing to lose\" and suffers from insecurity following Assad's fall.\n“What can he do? He should stand with strong will against those who designed and those who implemented the insecurity,\" Khamenei said. He also accused the United States and Israel of plotting against Assad's government in order to seize resources.\nIran and its militant allies in the region have suffered major setbacks over the past year, with Israel battering Hamas in Gaza and landing heavy blows on Hezbollah before they agreed to a ceasefire in Lebanon last month.\nKhamenei denied that such groups were proxies of Iran, saying they fought because of their beliefs. “If one day we plan to take action, we do not need proxy force,” he said.\nPreserving evidence of crimes\nThe head of a U.N.-backed team investigating crimes committed during the civil war said they are working with the country’s new authorities in hopes of preserving evidence uncovered after Assad’s ouster.\n“We welcome the fact that we were invited to come and to engage with the authorities,” Robert Petit said Sunday, describing the meeting as “constructive.”\nAs journalists, researchers and the public stream into former detention centers and mass grave sites, many express fears that evidence is taken or destroyed.\nWafa Mustafa, a Syrian activist whose father, Ali, disappeared in 2013 in Damascus, said that \"no one gets to tell the families what happened without evidence, without search, without work, without effort.”\nReturning Syrians search for shattered homes\n\nSyria's civil war created millions of refugees, and thousands have begun returning. In a gray field of rubble outside Damascus, returnee Alaa Badawi worked with a shovel, looking for traces of his home.\nHis community, Qaboun, was an anti-government center and many of its buildings were flattened under Assad's administration.\n“Which is our house? Which is our alley? There is nothing visible,” Badawi said.\nHe and others decided to dig a little here and there to look for the house's distinctive tiles. “We finally discovered that this is our house,” he said. \"I do not know by then if I was happy to have located the house amid the rubble or upset because the house did not exist.”\nZiad Al-Hilli, one of the many people freed from prison as Assad fled to Russia, could not find his house, or his family.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Nasser Karimi in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow AP’s Syria coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/syria\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukrainian drones struck a major Russian fuel depot for the second time in just over a week on Sunday, according to a senior Russian regional official, as part of a “massive” cross-border attack on fuel and energy facilities that Kyiv says supply Moscow's military. \nThe strikes came days after Russia launched sweeping attacks on Ukraine’s already battered energy grid, threatening to plunge thousands of homes into darkness as winter tightens its grip over the region, and as Russia’s all-out invasion of its neighbor nears the three-year mark.\nA fire broke out at the Stalnoy Kon oil terminal in Russia’s southern Oryol region, local Gov. Andrey Klychkov said in a post on the Telegram messaging app, adding Russian forces downed 20 drones targeting “fuel and energy infrastructure” in the province.\nRussian independent news outlet Astra shared video of what it said was an explosion at the site, showing a massive orange blaze lighting up the night sky. While the clip could not be independently verified, it was later shared by a Ukrainian security official who described it as footage from Oryol.\nThe official, Andriy Kovalenko of the Council of National Security and Defense, claimed the Oryol fuel depot supplies Russian forces fighting in Ukraine and southern Russia, including the Kursk province where Ukrainian troops have dug in following a lightning incursion in August. \nAccording to Klychkov, the Russian local governor, the fire was extinguished hours later and did not cause casualties or “significant” damage.\nUkraine's military previously claimed to have struck the Stalnoy Kon terminal with drones on Dec. 14, causing a “powerful” blaze. \nOther key war-related developments from Ukraine and Russia:\n— Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday vowed retaliation after Ukrainian drones the day before struck residential buildings in the city of Kazan, in the Tatarstan region over 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) from the front line. Speaking to Tatarstan's regional governor, Rustam Minnikhanov, Putin asserted that anyone attacking Russia has to reckon with Moscow inflicting “many times greater damage” in return, but did not elaborate. His remarks were carried by Russian state news agencies. \nMinnikhanov's press service on Saturday said that eight drones attacked Kazan. Local authorities said there were no casualties. \n— A 30-year-old man died on the spot Sunday in Ukraine's southern Kherson region after a Russian drone dropped explosives nearby, local Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin reported. Hours earlier, Prokudin said that two other civilians died as a result of Russian drone strikes on the province late on Saturday. A man in his late 40s suffered fatal injuries from a drone blast, and a woman was found dead under rubble after another drone slammed into her house.\n— In the Kharkiv region in the northeast, a Russian drone strike Sunday severely injured a 56-year-old man as he walked down a road in the city of Kupiansk, local Gov. Oleh Syniehubov reported. He said the man would need to have at least one limb amputated as a result, but gave no further detail.\n— In the Kyiv suburb of Brovary, debris from a Russian drone sparked a fire late on Saturday on the roof of a 25-story tower block, according to regional Gov. Ruslan Kravchenko. There were no immediate reports of any casualties.\n— According to Ukraine’s Air Force, Russia launched 103 Iranian-made Shahed drones at its neighbor overnight into Sunday. Ukrainian air defense shot down 52 of the drones while another 44 failed to reach their targets, the force said in a statement, in a likely reference to electronic jamming. \n— Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had intercepted 42 Ukrainian drones launched overnight at Russian territory. According to the ministry, 20 of those were over the Oryol region, where the local governor said a blaze tore through the oil terminal.\n— Separately, Russian forces have continued grinding forward in Ukraine’s northeast, in addition to eking out gains near the eastern town of Kurakhove. On Sunday, Russia’s Defense Ministry reported that its troops had captured two northeastern settlements: Lozova in the Kharkiv region and Krasne in the Luhansk province. There was no immediate confirmation from Kyiv.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nST. MORITZ, Switzerland (AP) — Lindsey Vonn lost a chance to improve her ranking when the second race of her World Cup skiing comeback at age 40 was canceled on Sunday due to strong winds and poor visibility.\nOn Saturday, Vonn placed 14th in a super-G on the Corviglia course in St. Moritz to mark her return to the circuit after nearly six years of retirement.\nVonn lost time at the start of the race but then was competitive with the top-five finishers the rest of the way down.\n“It took her 20 seconds to get back into it, and then she was fine,” said Chris Knight, Vonn’s personal coach.\nAnother super-G had been scheduled for Sunday.\n“She’d like to be in the top 15 later in the season,” Knight told The Associated Press when the race was canceled. “What we’re aiming for the next races is to accumulate points and get a better start number around the girls who are competitive.”\nSince Vonn hadn’t raced in so long, she had to use a new wild card for former champions that enabled her to start No. 31. But that’s still long after the top-ranked skiers start, leaving her with a bumpier and more challenging course.\n“If we can get around those other girls on the same track in the same conditions then you really know what’s going on,” Knight said.\nVonn now won’t race again until the next speed weekend in St. Anton, Austria on Jan. 11-12, which features a downhill and a super-G.\nAfter St. Anton, she plans to compete in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy, and hopefully qualify for the world championships in Saalbach, Austria, in February.\nFor now, Vonn is heading home to Miami for the holidays. Then she will return to Europe for training in early January before resuming a near-full schedule of speed races.\n“We don’t have couple of races later on before finals on the schedule. But we’ll see,” Knight said. “I mean, it’s just moved so quickly.”\n___\nMore AP skiing: https://apnews.com/hub/skiing\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nABUJA, Nigeria (AP) — The death toll from stampedes during two Christmas charity events in Nigeria has increased from 13 to 32, police said Sunday. The victims, including at least four children, collapsed during crowd surges as people grew desperate for food items while the country grapples with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\nThe dead included 22 people in southeastern Anambra state’s Okija town, where a philanthropist on Saturday organized a food distribution, local police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. Ten others died in the capital, Abuja, during a church-organized similar charity event.\nPolice said they were investigating the two incidents, only days after another stampede in which 35 children were killed. \nAfrica’s most populous country is seeing a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas to ease economic hardship caused by a cost-of-living crisis.\nWitnesses of the Abuja stampede told The Associated Press there was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises at around 4 a.m., hours before gift items were to be shared.\nSome of them, including older people, waited overnight to get food, said Loveth Inyang, who rescued one baby from the crush.\nThe stampedes prompted growing calls for authorities to enforce safety measures at such events. Nigerian police also mandated that organizers obtain prior permission.\n\n",

      "headline": "Winter is hitting Gaza and many Palestinians have little protection from the cold",
      "subhead": "Nearly two million displaced Palestinians in Gaza are struggling to protect themselves from the coming winter",
      "body": "\n\nKHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Winter is hitting the Gaza Strip and many of the nearly 2 million Palestinians displaced by the devastating 14-month war with Israel are struggling to protect themselves from the wind, cold and rain.\nThere is a shortage of blankets and warm clothing, little wood for fires, and the tents and patched-together tarps families are living in have grown increasingly threadbare after months of heavy use, according to aid workers and residents.\nShadia Aiyada, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah to the coastal area of Muwasi, has only one blanket and a hot water bottle to keep her eight children from shivering inside their fragile tent.\n“We get scared every time we learn from the weather forecast that rainy and windy days are coming up because our tents are lifted with the wind. We fear that strong windy weather would knock out our tents one day while we’re inside,” she said.\nWith nighttime temperatures that can drop into the 40s (the mid-to-high single digits Celsius), Aiyada fears that her kids will get sick without warm clothing.\nWhen they fled their home, her children only had their summer clothes, she said. They have been forced to borrow some from relatives and friends to keep warm.\nThe United Nations warns of people living in precarious makeshift shelters that might not survive the winter. At least 945,000 people need winterization supplies, which have become prohibitively expensive in Gaza, the U.N. said in an update Tuesday. The U.N. also fears infectious disease, which spiked last winter, will climb again amid rising malnutrition.\nThe U.N. Agency for Palestinian Refugees, known as UNRWA, has been planning all year for winter in Gaza, but the aid it was able to get into the territory is “not even close to being enough for people,” said Louise Wateridge, an agency spokeswoman.\nUNRWA distributed 6,000 tents over the past four weeks in northern Gaza but was unable to get them to other parts of the Strip, including areas where there has been fighting. About 22,000 tents have been stuck in Jordan and 600,000 blankets and 33 truckloads of mattresses have been sitting in Egypt since the summer because the agency doesn’t have Israeli approval or a safe route to bring them into Gaza and because it had to prioritize desperately needed food aid, Wateridge said.\nMany of the mattresses and blankets have since been looted or destroyed by the weather and rodents, she said.\nThe International Rescue Committee is struggling to bring in children’s winter clothing because there “are a lot of approvals to get from relevant authorities,” said Dionne Wong, the organization’s deputy director of programs for the occupied Palestinian territories.\n“The ability for Palestinians to prepare for winter is essentially very limited,” Wong said.\nThe Israeli government agency responsible for coordinating aid shipments into Gaza said in a statement that Israel has worked for months with international organizations to prepare Gaza for the winter, including facilitating the shipment of heaters, warm clothing, tents and blankets into the territory. \nMore than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry's count doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants, but it has said more than half of the fatalities are women and children. The Israeli military says it has killed more than 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.\nThe war was sparked by Hamas’ October 2023 attack on southern Israel, where the militant group killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostages in Gaza.\nNegotiators say Israel and Hamas are inching toward a ceasefire deal, which would include a surge in aid into the territory. \nFor now, the winter clothing for sale in Gaza's markets is far too expensive for most people to afford, residents and aid workers said.\nReda Abu Zarada, 50, who was displaced from northern Gaza with her family, said the adults sleep with the children in their arms to keep them warm inside their tent.\n“Rats walk on us at night because we don’t have doors and tents are torn. The blankets don’t keep us warm. We feel frost coming out from the ground. We wake up freezing in the morning,” she said. “I’m scared of waking up one day to find one of the children frozen to death.”\nOn Thursday night, she fought through knee pain exacerbated by cold weather to fry zucchini over a fire made of paper and cardboard scraps outside their tent. She hoped the small meal would warm the children before bed.\nOmar Shabet, who is displaced from Gaza City and staying with his three children, feared that lighting a fire outside his tent would make his family a target for Israeli warplanes.\n“We go inside our tents after sunset and don’t go out because it is very cold and it gets colder by midnight,” he said. “My 7-year-old daughter almost cries at night because of how cold she is.”\n\n",

      "subhead": "Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip have killed at least 22 people, including five children",
      "body": "\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday killed at least 22 people, including five children, Palestinian medical officials said, while Gaza's small Christian community celebrated a pre-Christmas Mass.\nIsraeli authorities allowed a rare Gaza visit by the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, for the Mass while the ever-present buzz of Israeli drones was heard outside.\nOne of the latest Israeli strikes hit a school housing displaced people in Gaza City and killed at least eight, including three children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Israel's military said it struck Hamas militants sheltering there.\nA strike on a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah late Saturday killed at least eight, including three women and two children, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. Another six people were killed in separate strikes on Sunday, according to local hospitals.\n“The children are still inside the house. We are looking for them. They were sleeping in the living room, five of them together,” said a relative of a victim, Noman Abu Samra, as people searched rubble in Deir al-Balah. A window full of children looked on.\nIsrael has carried out daily strikes in Gaza more than 14 months into the war with Hamas. It says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians, but the bombings frequently kill women and children.\nIsrael and Hamas recently appeared to draw closer to a ceasefire agreement that would include the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, but several obstacles remain, and the indirect talks have repeatedly stalled.\nVatican envoy celebrates Mass with Gaza's Christians\nDozens of worshipers gathered in the Holy Family Church in Gaza City as Pizzaballa and other clergy celebrated Mass. A twinkling Christmas tree was decorated with golden ornaments.\n“I want to say, to tell you, that all the world, not only the Christian world, all the world is with you, So the war will finish and we will rebuild,” the cardinal said, urging Gazans to never be afraid.\nHis visit came as Pope Francis again criticized Israel's actions in Gaza. Francis said Saturday that his envoy had been unable to enter the territory because of Israeli bombing.\n“Yesterday children have been bombed. This is cruelty, this is not war,” Francis said during his annual Christmas greetings at the Vatican. On Sunday, he called for a ceasefire.\nThe pope recently called for an investigation to determine if Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide, a conclusion later reached by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The International Court of Justice is investigating genocide allegations brought against Israel by South Africa.\nIsrael, which was founded as a refuge for Jews after the Nazi Holocaust, rejects such allegations. It says it is only at war with Hamas, which it accuses of genocidal violence in the attack that ignited the war.\nNow winter sets in\nIn that Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third believed to be dead.\nIsrael’s subsequent bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count.\nThe offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in.\nIsrael has been carrying out a major operation in northern Gaza since early October, battling Hamas in the most isolated and heavily damaged part of the territory. Tens of thousands have fled as the military has ordered a complete evacuation and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter.\nThe Israeli military body overseeing civilian affairs in Gaza, known as COGAT, said on Friday it facilitated the evacuation of over 100 patients, caregivers and others from Kamal Adwan Hospital and Al-Awda Hospital in the north. They have struggled to function. COGAT said it also facilitated the delivery of 5,000 liters of fuel and food packages to the hospitals.\nKamal Adwan's director on Saturday asserted that Israel's military had ordered an evacuation and said shelling was occurring. Israel's military on Sunday said there was no evacuation order and it was unaware of any strikes there.\nPalestinian security force member killed in West Bank\nIn the volatile West Bank town of Jenin, militants shot and killed a member of the Palestinian security forces and wounded two others. The Western-backed Palestinian Authority launched a rare crackdown there this month.\nA statement from the security forces blamed the shooting on “outlaws,” without elaborating. The PA is internationally recognized but deeply unpopular among Palestinians, in part because it cooperates with Israel on security matters.\nThe PA exercises limited authority in population centers in the West Bank. Israel captured the territory in the 1967 Mideast War, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state.\n___\nGoldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.\n___\nFollow AP’s war coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump, said Saturday that she's removing herself from consideration to be a Florida senator — ending speculation that she could replace Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who has been tapped to be the incoming administration's secretary of state. \n\"After an incredible amount of thought, contemplation, and encouragement from so many, I have decided to remove my name from consideration for the United States Senate,\" Lara Trump posted on X. \nInstead, she promised a “big announcement to share in January.\" \nThe announcement comes weeks after Trump announced that she was stepping down as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, a move which raised questions about whether she might be vying for a Senate seat. \nIf Rubio is confirmed, his replacement — who would be chosen by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — would serve for two years until the next regularly scheduled election in 2026.\nElected as RNC co-chair in March, Trump was a key player in the GOP retaking the White House and control of the Senate, while maintaining a narrow House majority. What she does next could shape Republican politics, given her elevated political profile and her ties to the incoming president.\nThe idea of placing a Trump family member in the Senate had been backed by some Republicans, including Maye Musk, mother of Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who Trump has named co-head of a group tasked with reduce federal spending and regulations during his second term as president. \nRubio is expected to be swiftly confirmed to his new post by his Senate colleagues. DeSantis has said that Floridians are likely to know their next senator by the beginning of January. \n\n",

The bigger concern for the Chiefs quarterback was how he would stop, when all the weight and pressure and momentum would land squarely upon it.\nThe solution against Houston was simple: Mahomes didn't stop.\nThe two-time MVP kept chugging forward until he plowed into the end zone on a 15-yard scramble to cap the Chiefs' opening drive on Saturday. Mahomes proceeded to throw for 260 yards and another score, never once looking troubled by his ailing ankle, and led Kansas City to a 27-19 victory that put the Chiefs on the brink of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.\nThe Chiefs (14-1) can clinch the postseason bye and home-field advantage if Buffalo loses to or ties New England on Sunday. If the Bills win, Kansas City can wrap it up by beating Pittsburgh on Christmas Day — its third game in an 11-day span.\n“I ask a lot from the guys around me. I feel like if I'm going to ask them to play through pain and nicks and bruises, I've got to do it as well,” Mahomes said. “That's something that I pride myself on is being out there with my guys.”\nXavier Worthy had seven catches for 65 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 55 yards and another score, and Marquise Brown had five catches for 45 yards for Kansas City in his first game this season after recovering from a shoulder injury.\nThe result was what Chiefs coach Andy Reid called his team's most comprehensive performance of the season.\nAs for Mahomes?\n“He spoils the dog out of us, he's so tough,” Reid said. “You get used to it. But most guys don't come back from that like he did.”\nC.J. Stroud threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Houston (9-6), and one of those TD throws came at a great expense. Tank Dell, who had six catches for 98 yards, sustained a devastating knee injury on the play and was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he would remain overnight.\n“All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team,” Ryans said. “It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game, playing really well for us.”\nStroud was visibly shaken by the injury and had to be consoled by teammates on the sideline.\n“I mean, all you can really do is pray,” he said.\nThere were questions early in the week about whether Mahomes, who has a history of ankle injuries, would play at all after he sustained a high ankle sprain late in last week's win over Cleveland. But he was off the injury report by Friday, and he was on the field and leading the Chiefs to a touchdown on their opening possession.\nHis scramble for a score was merely the start of a back-and-forth first half.\nThe Texans answered with a 33-yard field goal, then went on a 13-play, 82-yard drive that ended with Stroud's touchdown toss to Dalton Schutlz. But the Chiefs quickly regained the lead when Hunt barreled into the end zone, and they tacked on a field goal a few minutes later after Stroud's second interception to lead 17-10 at the break.\nDell was hurt on the Texans' opening drive of the third quarter. He was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch but collided with teammate Jared Wayne on his way to the ground. He immediately grabbed his left knee, and players from both teams surrounded him as he was loaded onto a cart and driven from the field.\nKa'imi Fairbairn promptly missed the extra point, and any momentum Houston might've had disappeared.\nKansas City marched the other way, relying heavily on Worthy, who touched the ball four times on the drive. The first-round pick finished it off with an 8-yard reception, giving him a season high for receiving yards and his eighth touchdown of the year.\nThe teams matched fourth-quarter field goals, and the Texans took over trailing 27-19 with just over five minutes to go. But the Chiefs forced a three-and-out, getting a sack from Josh Williams on a cornerback blitz, and ran out the clock from there.\n“This was a great test versus a really good playoff team,” Ryans said. “This was a playoff atmosphere here today. I thought our guys battled the right way. We just have to finish.”\nTaylor time\nPop star Taylor Swift was on hand for the Chiefs' regular-season finale. She has been spending more time with her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia, including making a surprise visit to Children's Mercy Hospital.\nInjuries\nHouston: OG Shaq Mason (left knee) left on the fourth play of the game. FS Jimmie Ward (foot) was hurt late in the first half.\nKansas City: LB Jack Cochrane fractured his ankle on special teams in the first quarter. RT Jawaan Taylor (knee) left in the third quarter and DT Chris Jones sustained a minor calf strain in the fourth.\nUp next\nThe Chiefs head to Pittsburgh and Houston welcomes Baltimore for the NFL's doubleheader on Christmas Day.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — In a time of incessant change, Penn State linebacker Dominic DeLuca is a throwback. \nThe former walk-on's team might be one too.\nDeLuca was guaranteed nothing when he arrived on campus nearly four years ago without the promise of a scholarship or much of anything else. He poured himself into his craft, carving out a niche as a special teams ace while working his way into the rotation on a defense that considers itself the best in the country.\nWith sixth-seeded Penn State off to a somewhat jittery start on Saturday against SMU in the first round of the College Football Playoff, the Nittany Lions needed a jolt. \nDeLuca provided two.\nThe first came on a pick-6 that gave Penn State an early lead. The second cut short an SMU drive when the Mustangs were threatening to get back in the game and set the stage for a 38-10 blowout that pushed the Nittany Lions (12-2) into the CFP quarterfinals against third-seeded Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Eve.\n“Dom is just a baller,” Penn State head coach James Franklin said after picking up his 100th victory with the school.\nOne whose journey may become increasingly rare when the NCAA trims roster sizes to 105 starting next season. \n“It breaks my heart a little bit that maybe Dom isn’t here if these rules were in place (when he arrived),” Franklin said.\nThe old ones still exist, for now. And Franklin used them to build a team that now has as many wins as any of the 130 editions that came before it.\n“We're a college football program that everybody should be proud of because those guys are doing it the right way at a time when it’s more challenging than it’s ever been,” he said.\nLinebacker Tony Rojas added a pick-6 of his own and Penn State shut down Kevin Jennings and the high-powered Mustangs (11-3), whose breakout season ended amid a flurry of mistakes and miscues and did little to shed the notion — particularly by those in Alabama — that the ACC runners-up didn't necessarily deserve a spot in the 12-team field in the first place.\n“I can't control the debate,” SMU coach Rhett Lashlee said. “I can't control what people are going to say. We got in. Today we got beat. We got beat soundly by a very good team.”\nTwo weeks after getting pushed around by Oregon in the Big Ten title game, Penn State responded by forcing three turnovers and collecting three sacks while holding the Mustangs to season lows in points and yards (253).\n“We wanted to put on a defensive performance like we did,” Penn State defensive tackle Dvon J-Thomas said. “Two pick-6s. Stopped the run. Stopped the pass game. We truly shut everything down.”\nJennings, whose electrifying play fueled SMU’s undefeated regular-season sprint through the ACC, finished 20 of 36 for 195 yards with a late touchdown and three picks. He began the day by missing a wide-open tight end Matthew Hibner at the goal line to end the Mustangs’ promising opening possession, and things only got worse from there, for Jennings and everyone else who made the nearly 1,400-mile trip from Dallas to central Pennsylvania.\nHis flip to Brashard Smith on SMU’s second drive sailed over the running back’s head and into the arms of an awaiting DeLuca, who raced 23 yards to the end zone to give Penn State the lead. Early in the second quarter, Jennings scrambled to his right and threw against his body into triple coverage. Rojas snagged it and weaved 59 yards to stake the Nittany Lions to a 14-0 lead they never came close to squandering.\nKaytron Allen ran for two scores and Nick Singleton added another for the Nittany Lions, a bruising 1-yard gash late in the first half that put Penn State up 28-0. Singleton punctuated it by jawing with Franklin on the sideline.\n“He screamed at me and used some words ... and said ‘I’m a violent man,’” Franklin said. “I kind of agreed with him.”\nDrew Allar completed 13 of 22 passes for 127 yards while playing every meaningful snap after backup Beau Pribula — who occasionally and effectively spelled Allar throughout the year — entered the transfer portal earlier this week.\nAnd unlike the ACC title game against Clemson — when the Mustangs roared all the way back from a 17-point second-half deficit to tie it before falling on the final snap — this time there would be no rally.\nThe last two quarters were mostly a chance for the crowd of over 106,000 that braved temperatures in the low-20s with a pretty steady breeze to soak in the kind of big game victory that hasn't happened quite as often as they would like during James Franklin's largely successful 11-year tenure.\nWith one test now passed, another big one awaits in the desert on the last day of 2024.\nTakeaways\nSMU: The Mustangs' historic first season in the ACC after coming over from the American Athletic ended with a disappointing thud. If Jennings hits Hibner for a score, maybe things change. They'll have all offseason to think about it.\nPenn State: Singleton and Allen believe they are the best running back combination in the country. They certainly looked it while teaming up to run for 160 yards and three scores.\nUp next\nSMU: will try to back up their audacious ACC debut next fall, when their conference slate includes games against Miami, Clemson and Louisville.\nPenn State: Will try to win a 13th game for the first time in the program's 131-year history when it heads to the Fiesta Bowl, a game in which the Nittany Lions are 7-0 all-time.\n___\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

      "body": "\n\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) — Texans wide receiver Tank Dell was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center and the team said he would remain overnight after sustaining a severe left knee injury while making a 30-yard touchdown catch in a 27-19 loss to the Chiefs on Saturday.\nDell was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch on a pass from C.J. Stroud before colliding with Houston teammate Jared Wayne on the way to the ground. Dell immediately grabbed at his knee and Wayne signaled for team trainers, who spent several minutes working on the wide receiver while teammates waited anxiously.\nDell was eventually placed on a stretcher and driven in a covered medical cart off the field, and then he was taken to the hospital.\n“We'll get an update (Monday) on him,” Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. “All of our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team. It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game.”\nDell had six catches for 98 yards and the touchdown when he was hurt with 11:40 left in the third quarter.\nStroud, who is one of Dell's closest friends, was visibly shaken. He had tears in his eyes as he watched Dell get loaded onto the cart, and Stroud was still getting consoled by teammates when he walked back to the Houston sideline.\n“It's not easy to just let it go, especially (because) that's my best friend. It's not easy to move on and keep playing,” Stroud said. “I tried to do the best I could. My teammates helped me up. I appreciate the guys talking to me as I was going through it.”\nThe touchdown should have tied the game, but Ka'imi Fairbairn missed the ensuing extra point. The Chiefs took advantage of the momentum swing and marched 80 yards for a touchdown and a 24-16 lead, and they put away the game from there.\n“You see your brother go down and get hurt that way, it’s hard to bounce back,” Ryans said. “You see him and how distraught he was, it’s hard to bounce back. It’s hard to rebound, because we care about each other. It’s not just about getting back to football. We truly care about each other, and in that moment, the most important thing was making sure that Tank was OK.”\nIt's the second straight year Dell has sustained what is certain to be a season-ending injury. He fractured his fibula in Week 13 against the Broncos last season, just as the rookie was breaking out, and had surgery on it the following day.\nThen in April, the 25-year-old wide receiver was an innocent bystander at a private event in Sanford, Florida, when he sustained a minor gunshot wound. Dell spent a brief amount of time in the hospital but was able to return to Houston soon afterward.\n“He loves this game so much. I don’t think that’s much of a question,” Texans receiver Xavier Hutchinson said. “He’s going to fight back. He’s going to come back even stronger, like he did this year. It’s only a matter of time.”\nDell was the second Texans player carted off Saturday. Free safety Jimmie Ward hurt his foot late in the first half.\nEarlier in the game, the Texans' banged-up offensive line lost starting guard Shaq Mason to a knee injury on the fourth play, and backup lineman Blake Fisher had to be helped off with an undisclosed injury later in the first half. Their injuries came after Juice Scruggs, another starter on the offensive line, was declared inactive because of a foot injury.\nKansas City also sustained some significant injuries on a chilly, wind-swept Saturday.\nThe biggest was to defensive tackle Chris Jones, who was unable to finish after straining a calf. Chiefs coach Andy Reid would not say whether he thought the two-time All-Pro would be able to play against Pittsburgh on Christmas Day.\nChiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor did not return after straining his knee, while backup linebacker Jack Cochrane is likely done for the season after he fractured his ankle while blocking on a special teams early in the game.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\n",

      "subhead": "The Israeli military said a rocket fired from Yemen hit an area of Tel Aviv injuring 16 people on Saturday, and Houthi rebels later reported airstrikes in Yemen’s rebel-held capital, Sanaa",
      "body": "\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — A rocket fired from Yemen hit an area of Tel Aviv overnight, leaving 16 people injured by shattered glass, the Israeli military said Saturday, days after Israeli airstrikes hit Houthi rebels who have been launching missiles in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. \nAnother 14 people had minor injuries as they rushed to shelters when air raid sirens sounded before dawn, the military said.\nThe Houthis in a statement on Telegram said they had aimed a hypersonic ballistic missile at a military target that they did not identify. Israel's military said it was investigating, adding that “we emphasize that aerial defense is not hermetic.”\n“A flash of light, a blow and we fell to the ground. Big mess, broken glasses all over the place,” said Bar Katz, a resident of a damaged building.\nThe Houthis’ media office later reported airstrikes on Yemen’s Houthi-held capital, Sanaa. U.S. forces conducted airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command facility operated by the Houthis, the U.S. Central Command said in a statement on X.\nThe attack on Tel Aviv came after Israeli airstrikes on Sanaa and the port city of Hodeida killed at least nine people Thursday. The strikes came hours after a missile from Yemen hit a school building in central Israel. The Houthis also claimed a drone strike targeting an unspecified military target in central Israel that day.\nIsrael's military says the Iran-backed Houthis have launched more than 200 missiles and drones during the 14-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis have also attacked shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and say they won’t stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.\nThe Israeli strikes Thursday caused “considerable damage” to the Houthi-controlled Red Sea ports, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. The Hodeida port has been key for food shipments into Yemen in its decade-long civil war.\nIsraeli strikes in Gaza kill a dozen children\nMourners in Gaza held funerals for 19 Palestinians — 12 of them children — killed in Israeli strikes on Friday and overnight.\nOne strike hit a residential building in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least seven, including five children and one woman, and injuring 16 others, health officials said.\nIn Gaza City, a strike on a house killed 12, including seven children and two women, according to Al-Ahli Hospital where the bodies were taken. One man cradled a tiny shroud-wrapped body as mourners gathered.\nLater Saturday, al-Awda Hospital said an airstrike hit a house in Nuseirat and killed four people including two children, with 14 other people wounded. Israel's military said it was checking the report.\nAnd Saturday night, large explosions could be seen on the Gaza skyline. Five bodies arrived soon afterward at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\nMore than 45,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 2023, when a Hamas attack in Israel killed about 1,200 people and triggered the war. Gaza's Health Ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but has said more than half of fatalities are women and children.\nIsrael faces heavy international criticism over the unprecedented levels of civilian deaths in Gaza. It says it only targets militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in residential areas.\nNorthern Gaza hospital says it is told to evacuate\nThe director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya in largely isolated northern Gaza said in an online message late Saturday that Israel's military had told the facility to evacuate. \nDr. Husam Abu Safiyeh asserted that the intensive care unit, maternity ward and other departments were being targeted, and said evacuating would mean transferring 66 patients.\nIsrael's military in response to questions said it was “not aware of any strikes in the area of the hospital at this time.” There was no immediate response to questions about the reported evacuation order.\nGaza's Health Ministry earlier reported continuous gunfire and Israeli shelling near the hospital, and it issued an urgent appeal for medical and food supplies to be delivered to the facility as Israel's military pressed its latest offensive.\nSafiyeh has said the facility faced “severe shortages” including of food and asserted that requests for essential medical supplies and ways to maintain oxygen, water and electricity systems \"have largely gone unmet.”\nAid groups have said Israeli military operations and armed gangs have hindered their ability to distribute aid.\nThe Israeli military organization dealing with humanitarian affairs for Gaza said Saturday it had led an operation delivering thousands of food packages, flour and water to the Beit Hanoun area in the north..\nA killing in Syria\nIran on Saturday said unknown gunmen killed a local staffer of the Iranian Embassy in Syria in Damascus last Sunday, the official IRNA news agency said.\nIts report quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei as saying “terrorists” opened fire on Davood Bitaraf’s car. It did not say what he did with the embassy. The shooting happened the day that opposition fighters took Damascus and ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad.\nBaghaei said Iran considers Syria’s interim government responsible for finding and prosecuting those behind the killing. Iran had been a key Assad ally.\n___\nShurafa reported from Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip.

      "subhead": "A NASA spacecraft is about to make the closest approach to the sun",
      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — A NASA spacecraft aims to fly closer to the sun than any object sent before. \nThe Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to get a close-up look at the sun. Since then, it has flown straight through the sun's corona: the outer atmosphere visible during a total solar eclipse. \nThe next milestone: closest approach to the sun. Plans call for Parker on Tuesday to hurtle through the sizzling solar atmosphere and pass within a record-breaking 3.8 million miles (6 million kilometers) of the sun's surface. \nAt that moment, if the sun and Earth were at opposite ends of a football field, Parker \"would be on the 4-yard line,” said NASA's Joe Westlake.\nMission managers won't know how Parker fared until days after the flyby since the spacecraft will be out of communication range. \nParker planned to get more than seven times closer to the sun than previous spacecraft, hitting 430,000 mph (690,000 kph) at closest approach. It's the fastest spacecraft ever built and is outfitted with a heat shield that can withstand scorching temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit (1,371 degrees Celsius).\nIt'll continue circling the sun at this distance until at least September. Scientists hope to better understand why the corona is hundreds of times hotter than the sun’s surface and what drives the solar wind, the supersonic stream of charged particles constantly blasting away from the sun. \nThe sun's warming rays make life possible on Earth. But severe solar storms can temporarily scramble radio communications and disrupt power. \nThe sun is currently at the maximum phase of its 11-year cycle, triggering colorful auroras in unexpected places. \n“It both is our closest, friendliest neighbor,” Westlake said, “but also at times is a little angry.”\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

      "body": "\n\nBEIJING (AP) — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is “playing with fire.”\nU.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory and says must come under its control. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called “dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.”\nU.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack.\nThe $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts.\nTaiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's “commitment to our defense.”\nIn October, the U.S. approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, also drawing China’s criticism while Beijing has responded with war drills around Taiwan. \nTaiwan earlier this month demanded that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said undermed peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade.\nU.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. \nTrump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nKILLEEN, Texas (AP) — A pickup truck driver fleeing police careened through the doors of a JCPenney store in Texas and continued through a busy mall, injuring five people before he was fatally shot by officers, authorities said.\nThe truck crashed into the department store in Killeen, about 68 miles (109 kilometers) north of the state capital Austin, around 5:30 p.m. Saturday and continued into the building, striking people as it went, Sgt. Bryan Washko of the Texas Department of Public Safety said in an evening news briefing. \nEmergency medical services transported four victims from the mall to area hospitals and another traveled to a hospital separately. They ranged in age from 6 to 75 years old and their conditions were not immediately known, he said. \nThe chase began around 5 p.m. on Interstate 14 in Belton, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from Killeen, after authorities received calls about an erratic driver in a black pickup, Ofelia Miramontez of the Killeen Police Department said.\nThe driver then pulled off the road and drove into the parking lot of the mall.\n“The suspect drove through the doors and continued to drive through the JCPenney store, striking multiple people,” Washko said. “The trooper and the Killeen police officer continued on foot after this vehicle, which was driving through the store, actively running people over. He traveled several hundred yards.”\nOfficers from the state public safety department, Killeen and three other law enforcement agencies “engaged in gunfire to eliminate this threat,” Washko said.\nOne of the officers who traded gunfire with the suspect was working as a security guard at the mall and others were off duty, he said.\nWashko did not have information about the suspect's identity at the time of the briefing.\nWitnesses interviewed by local news outlets outside the mall said they heard multiple gunshots and saw people fleeing through the mall.\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Santa Claus has arrived in Rio de Janeiro — under water.\nStarting on Saturday, he’ll be spotted at AquaRio Marine Aquarium swimming with sharks during their daily fish feeding sessions as part of the city’s Christmas festivities.\nNine-year-old Guilherme Martins Matos said he’d seen Santa — or at least an impersonator — at the mall. That was cool, he said, but this was better.\n“Imagine him under water feeding the fish? It’s even cooler,” Guilherme told The Associated Press.\nThis version of Santa Claus is Felippe Luna, 39, a senior animal handler at AquaRio. What began as a joke among staff has become an annual tradition.\nDressed as Santa, Luna dives into the aquarium’s 924,602-gallon tank to feed marine animals, including sharks. “For the kids, seeing Santa Claus under water is already incredible. And Santa feeding a shark by hand? That’s unforgettable,” Luna said.\nThe Santa Claus dive runs daily at AquaRio through Dec. 25 at 1:30 p.m.\n____\nFollow AP’s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america\n\n",

      "body": "\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — Joe Mazzulla's Christmas greetings were costly.\nThe NBA fined the Boston Celtics coach $35,000 on Saturday “for aggressively pursuing and directing inappropriate language toward a game official” at the end of his team's loss to the Chicago Bulls on Thursday night.\nMazzulla's outburst followed Boston getting whistled for three technical fouls — he got one, Jaylen Brown got one and Jayson Tatum got one — in the fourth quarter of that 117-108 loss. When time expired, Mazzulla appeared to have some angry words for referee Justin Van Duyne.\nMazzulla later said he was just trying to spread holiday cheer to the referee crew.\n“I just hadn’t seen them in a while, so just a merry Christmas, happy holidays, wasn’t sure I was going to see them before the holiday,” Mazzulla explained in his postgame news conference. “I just can’t let a moment go by where you wish someone just the best to them and theirs and their families.”\nVideo of the exchange does not seem to indicate he was offering glad tidings.\nCrew chief Tony Brothers said after the game that Brown got his technical for questioning the integrity of an official. Tatum got his technical for “an overt action towards an official,” Brothers said.\nBrown said Van Duyne called him for a technical for no reason and that Mazzulla “didn't say anything” that would have merited a technical.\n“You can't threaten guys with a technical foul,” Brown said.\n___\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/NBA\n\n",
